you know , one of the inten@@ se p@@ lea@@ su@@ res of travel and one of the de@@ lights of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
just to know that j@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central rev@@ el@@ ation of anthro@@ po@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ ea@@ ge made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the k@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the and@@ es , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ d@@ entally the fellow that i tra@@ vel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ en@@ ting yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spir@@ itual life and cultural life that en@@ velo@@ ps the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ rations , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
it &apos;s the symbo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an astoni@@ sh@@ ingly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no bio@@ logists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- scar@@ ce@@ ly appro@@ aches what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
and the great indi@@ ca@@ tor of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of voca@@ bu@@ lar@@ y or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
a language is a fla@@ sh of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spir@@ itual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ velo@@ ped in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ lab@@ les of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it can@@ ton@@ ese .
let &apos;s make it ko@@ g@@ i . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a bri@@ ef journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west amaz@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ tho@@ logically they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distin@@ gu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ ven@@ s is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; lin@@ gu@@ istic ex@@ o@@ ga@@ my : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ tho@@ logical past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ oran@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an astoni@@ shing people first cont@@ acted peac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be frien@@ dly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the devi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but the wa@@ oran@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
but at the same time they had a per@@ spi@@ ca@@ ci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was astoni@@ shing .
their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really astoni@@ shing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton mac@@ out@@ es , and secur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
christi@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ hi@@ sm , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious beli@@ efs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
the spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to mom@@ ent@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the god .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and because you are pos@@ se@@ ssed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these astoni@@ shing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning e@@ mbers with imp@@ unity , a rather astoni@@ shing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when ca@@ tal@@ y@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the ko@@ g@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
de@@ scen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ quest , these people re@@ treated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic ma@@ ssi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
in a bloo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the sp@@ an@@ ish .
to this day , they remain r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ itual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ est@@ ered in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ kness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ ine@@ -@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of ge@@ station they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the eco@@ logical -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cry@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is af@@ fir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of intu@@ ition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke rou@@ s@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplicity , or alter@@ na@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke tho@@ re@@ a@@ u and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are neither s@@ enti@@ mental nor wea@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and r@@ itual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intu@@ ition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ the@@ d into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was raised in the forests of british colum@@ bia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the c@@ roo@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ bal spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their ha@@ mat@@ sa initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different re@@ alities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west amaz@@ on just last a@@ pri@@ l .
this is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
what makes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er phar@@ mac@@ o@@ logical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hall@@ uc@@ in@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ xed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine , 5@@ -@@ meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que paintings and lan@@ ding on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the di@@ ss@@ olution of reality .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es as hall@@ uc@@ in@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hall@@ uc@@ ination .
but the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found naturally in the human gu@@ t called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ da@@ se .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necessary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ mine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ logically un@@ related plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ e@@ mism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
well , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ f@@ an , has 17 vari@@ e@@ ties of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distin@@ gu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they estab@@ lish their ta@@ x@@ on@@ omy and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it sin@@ gs to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but somehow reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be rememb@@ ered for its wars or its technological innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bow and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ gy .
it &apos;s not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ fore@@ station in the hom@@ el@@ and of the pen@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from s@@ ara@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to ser@@ v@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters han@@ g light in the horiz@@ on ready to fill their holds with raw lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
you know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once tra@@ vel@@ led 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ a@@ stern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young colleag@@ ue , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n apart to du@@ st and a@@ shes , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the ca@@ dre@@ s during the cultural revolution .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen la@@ ma .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese inv@@ a@@ sion .
his un@@ cle f@@ led with his ho@@ lin@@ ess in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ ssion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthro@@ po@@ logist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ fted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hu@@ mb@@ ling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 50,000 &#93; years .
the ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ mb@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is b@@ arely 300 years old .
now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . and there are great moments of opti@@ mism .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , o@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to estab@@ lish our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father ref@@ used to go .
the family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by the arctic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and defe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he shaped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
he put a sp@@ ray of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze solid , he but@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
he sk@@ in@@ ned the dog and im@@ provi@@ sed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the dog and im@@ provi@@ sed a s@@ led , har@@ ne@@ ssed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in be@@ lt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbo@@ l of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in a@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and tex@@ as put together .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ u@@ t .
it &apos;s an independent terr@@ it@@ ory . they control all min@@ eral resources .
an amazing example of how a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state can see@@ k re@@ stitu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geo@@ graphy of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geo@@ graphic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ comp@@ lish anything .
we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s are not persu@@ a@@ sive , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
our magaz@@ ines are read by millions .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central rev@@ el@@ ation of anthro@@ po@@ logy : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ istic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to micro@@ soft as part of an acqui@@ si@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chapter .
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real represen@@ tation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
this is a more real@@ istic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inher@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve made up a fake ad that &apos;s very high res@@ olution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve embed@@ ded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real est@@ ate .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa geo@@ sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vi@@ sed by steve se@@ it@@ z at u.@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at micro@@ soft research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ res@@ olution experience .
but the sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al ar@@ ran@@ gement of the images here is actually meaningful .
the computer vision algorithms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gra@@ ss@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been related sp@@ a@@ ti@@ ally .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototy@@ pe of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so ap@@ parent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of no@@ t@@ re da@@ me ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done entirely compu@@ ta@@ tionally from images scra@@ ped from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type no@@ t@@ re da@@ me into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on . and each of these oran@@ ge con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to be@@ long to this model .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related sp@@ a@@ ti@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at micro@@ soft .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone cameras to professional s@@ l@@ r@@ s , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a pos@@ ter of no@@ t@@ re da@@ me that regi@@ ster@@ ed corre@@ ctly .
we can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , vi@@ sually , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to ste@@ ph@@ en law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting ta@@ gged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ ints and say who they all are , then my photo of no@@ t@@ re da@@ me ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and i can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta@@ -@@ ver@@ se , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cro@@ ss-@@ mod@@ al and cro@@ ss-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , collected not just from over@@ head f@@ lights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between images .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phra@@ ses , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
thanks so much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; off@@ icial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the off@@ icial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the off@@ icial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the off@@ icial do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
this , i think , is so deeply embed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply embed@@ ded in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sin@@ gs in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ gin o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sa@@ mic v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sin@@ gs , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ onics store to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spea@@ kers , c@@ d player , tape player , tun@@ er , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single consumer electr@@ onics store , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o systems .
we can construc@@ t si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communi@@ cations .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you ren@@ ted your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one con@@ sequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ m@@ mer , and cre@@ me bru@@ le@@ e tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their sto@@ res asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explo@@ sion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient auton@@ omy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shi@@ fting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- na@@ mely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- na@@ mely , the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pre@@ scri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pre@@ scrip@@ tions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
we don &apos;t inher@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ult assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ lig@@ ent .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are consu@@ ming questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are ble@@ ssed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the ran@@ dol@@ ph hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ f@@ i works .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , on our la@@ ps .
and even if they &apos;re all shut off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and life@@ style things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , para@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ rement plans .
a colleag@@ ue of mine got access to investment records from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emp@@ lo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of partici@@ pation went down two percent .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emp@@ lo@@ yer .
by not particip@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emp@@ lo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sin@@ gs to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative in@@ duc@@ es you to regre@@ t the decision you made , and this regre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regre@@ t anything at all that is disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you chose .
second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
dan g@@ il@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alter@@ na@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attrac@@ tive features of alter@@ na@@ tives that you re@@ ject , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ha@@ mp@@ tons .
very expensive real est@@ ate .
gor@@ geous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s au@@ gu@@ st .
everybody in my man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an neighborhood is away .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tract from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attrac@@ tive features of these options are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re cho@@ o@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ o@@ sing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attrac@@ tive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attrac@@ tive .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and wa@@ shed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ xed fit ?
you want but@@ ton fly or zi@@ pper fly ? you want st@@ one@@ wa@@ shed or aci@@ d-@@ wa@@ shed ?
do you want them di@@ stre@@ ssed ?
you want boo@@ t cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; on and on he went .
my ja@@ w dropped , and after i reco@@ vered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ f@@ itting je@@ ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
when they came in 100 fla@@ v@@ ors , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
ad@@ ding options to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a ple@@ as@@ ant surprise .
now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , the world we live in -- we a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be ple@@ as@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t set@@ tle .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a bad@@ -@@ f@@ itting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disa@@ p@@ pointed about them ; they bla@@ me themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explo@@ sion of depression , and also su@@ icide , is that people have experiences that are disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ult .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ ctively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the off@@ icial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ liar problem of modern , a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve lev@@ it@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shi@@ fted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .
this is what economists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gu@@ es us .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisticated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this fish@@ bo@@ wl . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sha@@ tter the fish@@ bo@@ wl so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you sha@@ tter this fish@@ bo@@ wl so that everything is possible , you decre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you decre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a fish@@ bo@@ wl .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the ab@@ s@@ ence of some metaph@@ ori@@ cal fish@@ bo@@ wl is a reci@@ pe for miser@@ y , and , i su@@ spect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ the@@ si@@ zing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bio@@ logists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various appro@@ aches , par@@ ing it down to min@@ ima@@ l components .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ enced the human genome , it was going from the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
this is the map of a small organism , my@@ cop@@ la@@ sm@@ a gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ alle@@ st genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its me@@ tabo@@ lic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would yi@@ eld a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ the@@ size this chro@@ mo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ the@@ size a chro@@ mo@@ some ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boo@@ t up a chro@@ mo@@ some ?
a chro@@ mo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ er@@ t chemical material .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an expon@@ ential p@@ ace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an expon@@ ential curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out syn@@ the@@ si@@ zing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ rors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the er@@ rors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kil@@ ls bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error corre@@ ction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ er@@ t chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vir@@ al particles .
the vir@@ al particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chro@@ mo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in ca@@ s@@ set@@ tes the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the ca@@ s@@ set@@ tes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequ@@ enced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accur@@ acy was one error per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we actually found , on re@@ sequ@@ encing it , 30 er@@ rors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller su@@ bun@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
think of this : we have a four-@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
initi@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ graph it .
some people were disa@@ p@@ pointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes ; there are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely ro@@ bust that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ isms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called de@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chro@@ mo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally de@@ sic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yea@@ st mechan@@ isms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yea@@ st puts them together automatically .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light micro@@ scope .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boo@@ t up a chro@@ mo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also si@@ m@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
with bacteria and ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the chro@@ mo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a chro@@ mo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chro@@ mo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice -- we added a few extra genes so we could se@@ lect for this chro@@ mo@@ some , we di@@ ge@@ sted it with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisticated graphics here .
the new chro@@ mo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chro@@ mo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mi@@ ssed much of biology .
there are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes called restri@@ ction en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
the chro@@ mo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chro@@ mo@@ some we put in does .
it got ex@@ pressed and it recogn@@ ized the other chro@@ mo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chro@@ mo@@ some .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the character@@ is@@ tics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the me@@ mb@@ ran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the ca@@ mb@@ ri@@ an explo@@ sion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble feeding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ cines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 bil@@ li@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ re@@ ls of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ re@@ ls a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electr@@ onics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these ra@@ pid metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or to produce phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new vac@@ cines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard selection : we can se@@ lect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen sna@@ p@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fuels .
you &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to e@@ than@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fuels like o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
this is an organism we described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ atures .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have mode@@ st goals of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vac@@ cines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al vac@@ cines in adv@@ ance .
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spee@@ ding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introduc@@ tion to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ li@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ ctors .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ l@@ as dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 2@@ 2 meters in dia@@ meter .
spect@@ acu@@ lar picture here of at@@ l@@ as under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by at@@ l@@ as .
it caused im@@ men@@ se cele@@ bra@@ tion in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
those wi@@ res carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ ints between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufacturing defe@@ ct .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fi@@ xed them .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to refu@@ te .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ aching , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hu@@ m@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i su@@ spect , when def@@ ending his prote@@ ge &apos;s use@@ less experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my profes@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fas@@ c@@ ination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ liar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to re@@ cali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work .
and the pe@@ cu@@ liar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , p@@ ray , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , international be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler thing .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
seriously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teen@@ ager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based reaction .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction will kill you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter as@@ h of failure ? &quot;
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things be@@ sides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
like se@@ awe@@ ed , and other things that are sc@@ ary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative ven@@ tures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t re@@ call once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the centuries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
we writ@@ ers , we kind of do have that repu@@ tation , and not just writ@@ ers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this repu@@ tation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really mag@@ nific@@ ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it su@@ icide seem to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ fts , you know .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
but we don &apos;t even b@@ link when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely inter@@ n@@ alized and accep@@ ted collec@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher@@ ently linked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ e@@ din@@ gly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ a@@ k@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ e@@ din@@ gly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , so je@@ sus , what a thought !
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king gin at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflec@@ tion , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psycho@@ logical construc@@ t , right ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural an@@ xi@@ ety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inher@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
people believed that creativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ its of creativity &quot; da@@ e@@ mon@@ s . &quot;
so@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
the roman@@ s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a genius .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ b@@ by the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bly assi@@ st the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psycho@@ logical construc@@ t to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died genius who had helped you .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fa@@ ult , you know ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of la@@ me .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and my@@ ster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ ternal mystery is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fra@@ gile , human psych@@ e .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expec@@ tations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ timate scientific susp@@ ici@@ ons about the notion of , basically fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ bb@@ ing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ pri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ra@@ tionally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had this en@@ counter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural vir@@ gin@@ ia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ re@@ ling down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting cha@@ sed by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem pas@@ ses through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
and in these inst@@ ances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pi@@ pe@@ line !
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have bru@@ shed up against that thing , at times .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that i have of how to do that is the musici@@ an tom wa@@ its , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented con@@ temporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able creative im@@ pul@@ ses that were totally inter@@ n@@ alized .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angel@@ es he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he &apos;s spee@@ ding along , and all of a sudden he hear@@ s this little fra@@ gment of me@@ lo@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tal@@ izing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ geous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recor@@ der .
so he starts to feel all of that old an@@ xi@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ un@@ e moment when i can take care of you .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
go bo@@ ther le@@ on@@ ard co@@ h@@ en . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy an@@ xi@@ ety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ liar , won@@ d@@ rou@@ s , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , p@@ ray , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of desp@@ air that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
but then i rememb@@ ered tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just li@@ fted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i dire@@ cted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
and i said al@@ ou@@ d , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fa@@ ult , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and i would please like the record to ref@@ lect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- centuries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
and they were always mag@@ nific@@ ent , because the dan@@ cers were profes@@ sion@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
but every once in a while , very r@@ arely , something would happen , and one of these perfor@@ mers would actually become tran@@ scen@@ dent .
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would ali@@ g@@ n .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
he would be l@@ it from within , and l@@ it from below and all l@@ it up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern sp@@ ain , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centuries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fla@@ men@@ co dan@@ ces .
in sp@@ ain , when a perfor@@ mer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , o@@ le , o@@ le , al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ nific@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad kne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , frigh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ a@@ k@@ ish success .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psy@@ ched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the di@@ v@@ ine , co@@ cke@@ yed genius as@@ signed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your effor@@ ts , then &quot; o@@ le ! &quot;
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and &quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ e@@ the@@ less .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ e@@ the@@ less , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
o@@ le !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the arctic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
but this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ic@@ kness of the ice .
the arctic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
it exp@@ ands in winter and con@@ trac@@ ts in summer .
the next slide i show you will be a ra@@ pid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it con@@ trac@@ ts in summer .
the so-@@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ il@@ ling out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
already in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bu@@ bb@@ ling up out of the water .
professor k@@ ate@@ y wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ allow lake last winter .
who@@ a !
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
but the volu@@ mes are much larger than ever .
this is the k@@ an@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level ri@@ ses from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly ra@@ pid in its mel@@ ting .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
the flo@@ ws have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ now@@ pack .
this is h@@ itting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predi@@ ctions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fi@@ res .
and the disa@@ sters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the ameri@@ ca@@ s , exten@@ ding we@@ st@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ fore@@ station , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green alter@@ na@@ tives pro@@ posed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image remin@@ ded me of something .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy soul .
he &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday .
he &apos;s affor@@ dable and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in west vir@@ gin@@ ia .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
let me be clear about it . al g@@ ore , nan@@ cy pe@@ lo@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the al@@ li@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campa@@ ig@@ ns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ gy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adverti@@ sing effort to help bring out and compli@@ cate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a t@@ our of this state@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean coal fac@@ ility .
amazing ! the mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of lou@@ d .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative me@@ shes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the th@@ read that lin@@ ks them all : our addi@@ ction to carbon based fuels , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bo@@ ld new solution to get us out of this mess .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more se@@ cure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
re@@ power america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
one of the fa@@ ste@@ st ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fuels that are killing our planet .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gra@@ s@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al relationships .
sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al reason@@ ing is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ til@@ ity of our inter@@ actions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vi@@ ser pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an k@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p moving around a flat de@@ sk@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gra@@ s@@ p information physically , ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so compe@@ lling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ f@@ tables .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ f@@ table is an interactive computer the size of a coo@@ ki@@ e .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by re@@ aching out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
and si@@ f@@ tables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it ro@@ l@@ ls it back@@ wards .
and these interactive portra@@ its are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surr@@ ounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday ge@@ stu@@ res on data , like po@@ uring a color the way we might po@@ ur a liquid .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and i can use them to po@@ ur color into that central one , where they get mi@@ xed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ c@@ i sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ ggle .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a dic@@ tionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it re@@ shu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of appli@@ cation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instruc@@ tions .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
that &apos;s our youn@@ gest be@@ ta te@@ ster , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ f@@ tables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive carto@@ on appli@@ cation .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ fting the si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he &apos;s brought a trac@@ tor into the scene .
the oran@@ ge trac@@ tor .
good job ! yeah !
so by sha@@ king the si@@ f@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of !
inven@@ ting his own narrative .
hel@@ lo !
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ encing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can in@@ ject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemb@@ le into the pattern that you want .
and you in@@ ject it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ f@@ table against a sequence si@@ f@@ table .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ f@@ tables , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
now i put a bas@@ s line in .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more expression .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it pla@@ ys .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in adv@@ ance , but i can im@@ provi@@ se , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volume si@@ f@@ table , til@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
yes , hel@@ lo .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned the@@ ore@@ tically into practice .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
so it was curi@@ osity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
there are controver@@ si@@ al top@@ ics such as all those gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants in the fields .
now there &apos;s cra@@ i@@ g ven@@ ter in the us@@ a who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ di@@ e@@ sel fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as wa@@ shing po@@ w@@ der en@@ z@@ y@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clothes at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ tically opti@@ mis@@ ed en@@ z@@ y@@ mes .
and the list can go on forever .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more .
so what why ha@@ cking ?
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on .
that &apos;s rather sad for the ha@@ ck@@ er community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
software ha@@ ck@@ ers started building computers in the sev@@ enti@@ es and ei@@ gh@@ ties and this gave rise to the internet .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m@@ -@@ solving in a play@@ ful , creative , original way .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electr@@ onics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ k@@ er@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circu@@ its .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ ia do@@ t or@@ g , which origin@@ ally comes from swit@@ zer@@ land , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosoph@@ ers are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge crea@@ tively , there are museum exhibi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .
but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bio@@ - d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g , di@@ y bi@@ o .
that &apos;s a network from the us@@ a , that &apos;s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ u@@ ss things online .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to bri@@ ef@@ ly describe .
this picture on the left is of bio@@ curious , that &apos;s a ha@@ ck@@ er@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit organ@@ i@@ sation institution , where anybody can go to .
children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam@@ ine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto@@ col@@ s .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ e@@ sia , house of natural fi@@ bers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electronic tin@@ k@@ ering , and combine this in a very out@@ lan@@ dish way .
a group from an@@ kar@@ a , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organ@@ is@@ ed these these little actions at street fes@@ tiv@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .
and in this other image at the top i have a lec@@ ture in in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical muse@@ i@@ on in combination with an exhibi@@ tion on the topic .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fas@@ c@@ ination with technology .
and what you can do with it and appro@@ aching society very tar@@ ge@@ te@@ dly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , okay , to ha@@ ck into biology , you need material .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staff , trained acade@@ mic@@ s with a doctor &apos;s degree et@@ c. only .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
and so with this pre@@ mi@@ ses with this pre@@ mi@@ ses , bri@@ an de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laboratory , took a pressure co@@ ok@@ er , a hot plate and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with it , working like this .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a sou@@ p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity test , so dna fin@@ ger@@ printing in other words , at home again .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a closed up gar@@ age with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to bri@@ ef@@ ly mention a project .
that here is bio@@ curious , the ha@@ ck@@ er@@ space i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organ@@ i@@ sa@@ tions , who are doing this more for@@ m@@ ally in an institu@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ ed form already .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acces@@ sible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always cha@@ tting there and everything .
and then the foun@@ der of do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g came and said : okay
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organ@@ is@@ ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly after that in the us@@ a , in san francisco .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ c@@ tives , our fundamental principles ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduc@@ t .
that was really intuitive , i mean , everyone ex@@ pressed their wi@@ shes , their and things that move them .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
and that was then it &apos;s not bin@@ ding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accep@@ ted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ er scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the acade@@ mic world .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ ia network in swit@@ zer@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical tw@@ ee@@ z@@ ers .
this is when you focus a la@@ ser be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a trac@@ tor be@@ am .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ ca@@ m , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a micro@@ scope , which has a four hundred fold mag@@ ni@@ fication appro@@ xim@@ ately .
you can see this at the bottom .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the la@@ ser and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an ee@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his nic@@ k@@ name is sa@@ m neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum .
vi@@ sit@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met .
their brain waves were then measured , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swit@@ ched on .
was a very a very f@@ ancy project .
another thing from the us@@ a that also had to do with pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity test thing , is the the p@@ c@@ r , the poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction , a complicated term .
this is about the cop@@ ying of genes , repli@@ cating genes , dna , fra@@ g@@ ments , so that you can make them visible .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair be@@ lon@@ gs to this person , like that .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy comm@@ er@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
and that &apos;s not within the range of am@@ ate@@ urs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so that &apos;s just one appli@@ cation among many that you can use .
and they have there were two two tin@@ k@@ er@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and chea@@ per , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware and electr@@ onics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the chea@@ pest provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more acces@@ sible .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opinion .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which sho@@ ots about this far , two centi@@ me@@ tre@@ s or so .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my my prototy@@ pe , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electr@@ onics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ sp@@ en@@ ser and connected it to that .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ sp@@ en@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to six@@ ty bar .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ gly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , whereas whi@@ pped cre@@ am di@@ sp@@ en@@ s@@ ers cost about fif@@ ty euro@@ s .
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically do@@ able .
so that &apos;s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sibility , so that that more people can get involved .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educa@@ ting themselves really well on it .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dary literature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if , as an in@@ formed citiz@@ en , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and this tra@@ des under the names open knowledge and citiz@@ en science .
so as a citiz@@ en you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concer@@ n of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
those are the people who are at least off@@ ici@@ ally regi@@ ster@@ ed on the website , the di@@ y-@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ org@@ -@@ website .
there &apos;s already a rather im@@ pres@@ sive number of people worldwide .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represen@@ ted in sou@@ th-@@ ea@@ st-@@ asia .
that is i think they are less people have regi@@ ster@@ ed than actually exist .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed .
and they are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , individuals .
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with the ha@@ ck@@ er@@ spaces , those places .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
and ha@@ ck@@ er@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ ck@@ er@@ spaces , c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en n@@ ine@@ ty@@ -@@ five .
and that &apos;s become a gi@@ gan@@ tic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent@@ res , which are being represen@@ ted all over the world .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll expand in a similar way and also be simil@@ arly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
and i would like to inv@@ ite everyone to work on it and event try something y@@ ourselves .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
thanks for listening .
that was all .
yes , hel@@ lo .
how do we humans actually function ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satis@@ fying result possible .
i think that interactive media address ar@@ cha@@ ic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were program@@ med into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be e@@ lic@@ ited through interactive media .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our ar@@ cha@@ ic roots .
so what are ar@@ cha@@ ic models ?
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them bri@@ ef@@ ly .
ar@@ cha@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times .
in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic to these ar@@ cha@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with vir@@ tu@@ ality .
that might sound unusual at first .
i will clar@@ i@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural re@@ lation to vir@@ tu@@ ality .
and the second aspect is that since we because of these ar@@ cha@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
and the third area spea@@ ks for itself really .
we all know that interactive media is , by definition , non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ gation of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider lin@@ ear@@ ity normal today .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
but how is it with with vir@@ tu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i would like to prove that to you .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ?
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are .
that is exactly what you are doing .
you are vir@@ tu@@ al@@ is@@ ing the reality without a computer .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
at the media cam@@ pu@@ s , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to ren@@ der virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and this this ability to vir@@ tu@@ ali@@ se the virtual reality was something that people in pre-@@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
and they didn &apos;t have photo@@ li@@ tho@@ graphy .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their mind .
and in this mind they had memory .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ gly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with vir@@ tu@@ ality .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produc@@ er and medium .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
what is the media today ?
you will notice that a change has taken place .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
a cru@@ ci@@ al tool in information bro@@ k@@ er@@ age has always been stories .
sha@@ man@@ s , pri@@ ests , so-@@ called kee@@ pers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally as@@ signed to pre@@ serve knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very depen@@ dent on stories .
according to the author of the book the story@@ telling animal , j@@ on@@ a@@ than got@@ t@@ sch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the re@@ ception of stories .
that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life recei@@ ving stories .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
what is particularly im@@ pres@@ sive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we &apos;ve an@@ cho@@ red the ability to think in a non-@@ lin@@ ear way in our biological memory .
i brought along an example of the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navi@@ gate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and they did this using so-@@ called lead maps .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the austr@@ alian ab@@ origin@@ als .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so-@@ called son@@ g@@ lines , or dre@@ am@@ pa@@ ths
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graphy of regions could be de@@ pic@@ ted through songs .
and for them language had inf@@ eri@@ or importance .
that means they navi@@ g@@ ated through the use of sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the geo@@ logy and to@@ po@@ graphy of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ fra@@ gment these songs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
at least not to navi@@ gate .
what what happened there ?
what happened is the the so-@@ called machine age .
before this , we were in the so-@@ called age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ alism .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photo@@ li@@ tho@@ graphy .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media .
to the book and to the image .
the con@@ sequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to vir@@ tu@@ ali@@ se .
vir@@ tu@@ ality has suddenly become something ali@@ en to us
and has nothing more to do with reality .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design research@@ er at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@ c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@ ies to stone and have ero@@ ded our ability to vir@@ tu@@ ali@@ se .
let &apos;s make a short provi@@ sional app@@ rais@@ al .
from the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ alism to the to the machine age .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
those are the de@@ clin@@ ing influ@@ ences of the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the centuries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
that means that instead of having individual memor@@ ies , we have stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed , wi@@ de@@ spread patterns of memor@@ ies , onto which we can att@@ ach our personal memor@@ ies .
we no longer produce .
we have an abstract an abstr@@ acted language .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but co@@ di@@ fy them through language .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a lin@@ ear fashion .
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , such as non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
what &apos;s left is story@@ telling .
we &apos;re still extremely att@@ ached to story@@ telling as a method of information bro@@ k@@ er@@ age .
the question is , what will come next ?
we had the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fic@@ tion , i know .
but the concepts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
this is about vir@@ tu@@ ality , about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , about story@@ telling .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
there are technical concepts such as “ au@@ g@@ mented reality ” .
so if you think of the google gla@@ sses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our a@@ ff@@ in@@ ity for vir@@ tu@@ ali@@ sation , of experi@@ encing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addre@@ ssed again .
another example is so-@@ called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the ho@@ lo@@ de@@ ck .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human intellig@@ ently .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept vir@@ tu@@ ality as a real living space .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s projects by michael bur@@ k , ann@@ -@@ k@@ ath@@ r@@ in k@@ ren@@ z , j@@ or@@ is k@@ la@@ use and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z m@@ ü@@ l@@ ler .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
perhaps you could just bri@@ ef@@ ly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
i brought this project along as an example to illustr@@ ate how these ar@@ cha@@ ic , cognitive models are being addre@@ ssed again .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ates for story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of per@@ sons people ju@@ mp@@ ing around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ so@@ le .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
this is a game for outside .
and it was ex@@ press@@ ly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
you can explain this much more el@@ ab@@ or@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively on twitter .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different im@@ pression , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can take a look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my presentation by st@@ ating that the character@@ is@@ tics and abilities that we acqui@@ red during the age of fe@@ u@@ d@@ alism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be re@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
i was just asked whether this s@@ ack is a talking s@@ ack and will talk for me .
it won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the susp@@ en@@ se .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with be@@ sides your existence as a designer .
when profes@@ sors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the topic natural user interface design .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concer@@ n themselves with such natural , ar@@ cha@@ ic prototy@@ pes of communication , interaction , etc .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user frien@@ dly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user frien@@ dly or intuitive .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ ces@@ si@@ vely transformed itself from a calcul@@ ator to a digital assi@@ stant .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed bri@@ ef@@ ly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
from the modern to the computer society .
each society is character@@ is@@ ed by one primary medium .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ bal society , character@@ is@@ ed by language .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tri@@ bal society .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ ces@@ si@@ vely and relatively naturally .
that was then re@@ placed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstr@@ action .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fe@@ st itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu@@ id and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so mani@@ pu@@ late it .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to when someone ex@@ pre@@ sses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the primary medium , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
that was also an a@@ ff@@ ron@@ t at the time , where the gen@@ try , cl@@ er@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fat@@ al of course .
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ encing it .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc .
with its complete trans@@ par@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that cla@@ shes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the la@@ sa@@ gn@@ e and not be@@ ef or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not conf@@ ess to it .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are cla@@ shing with each other at the moment .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechan@@ isms , principles and ar@@ cha@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tri@@ bal society .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the theme of eco@@ logy is a global theme .
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete trans@@ par@@ ency .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an a@@ ff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
we &apos;re accu@@ mul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re accu@@ mul@@ ating it increasingly quic@@ ker and better , for example .
just like it used to happen in the village .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user frien@@ dly , so that anybody can use it ?
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be impro@@ ved too .
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user frien@@ dly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and what does intuitive mean and how do our chan@@ ne@@ ls of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ?
like steve jobs once said : you need to di@@ g deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user frien@@ dly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundamentally .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven off@@ ici@@ ally recogn@@ is@@ ed senses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be added to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .
and to see how we process information , how do we absor@@ b information ?
and just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible .
and of course how design affe@@ cts perception .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is sal@@ t and which one is pe@@ pper , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a con@@ tain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains sal@@ t and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pper .
and if i say to someone , pass me the sal@@ t or the pe@@ pper , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the sal@@ t , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
but our perception , how it de@@ cei@@ ves us too .
for example perception in this context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern reco@@ gni@@ tion should also work .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my gla@@ sses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle is starting to corre@@ late or associ@@ ate a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
this is called a law of design or ge@@ st@@ al@@ t psychology , which in turn affe@@ cts our perception .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
the law of pro@@ xim@@ ity , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term .
but it &apos;s an essential component , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
that might sound mun@@ dan@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
that &apos;s wrong .
first you see from back to front .
because you project an assu@@ mption that you &apos;re seeing something you reco@@ gni@@ se to the front , such as a circle .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something you want to see .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the sp@@ an of milli@@ seconds in which these things happen .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
everybody is now trying to reco@@ gni@@ se something in this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recogn@@ is@@ es what .
does anyone see anything specific ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian , exactly .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian in this , you know it .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian is .
now you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
that means i &apos;ve corru@@ p@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian to the front .
then i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tian .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ din@@ gly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se@@ -@@ tin@@ ted area .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
a long time , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds .
he will have to process that as the present .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very ele@@ g@@ ant way , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five milli@@ seconds ?
yes , milli@@ seconds .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
that means the first im@@ pression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we percei@@ ve things .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ din@@ gly .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the topic of per@@ cep@@ tions and ne@@ ural processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so forma@@ l aspe@@ cts or forma@@ l a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts .
there are indi@@ ca@@ tor functions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
but there are also symbo@@ lic functions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous su@@ ms of money on such a little bag that you can har@@ dly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satis@@ fying way possible .
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says .
how can i make something as user frien@@ dly as possible ?
can i handle it directly or do i need a man@@ ual or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training .
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user frien@@ dly .
making it differently or pret@@ ti@@ er doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why n@@ ine@@ ty@@ -@@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intuitive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pa@@ d in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intuitive than classi@@ cal software .
intuitive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an ele@@ mentary economic factor , an ele@@ mentary success factor , when apple appe@@ ared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices us@@ able for people .
why ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emp@@ lo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ din@@ gly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a ne@@ ural model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a de@@ sk@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cry@@ p@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
that made the whole thing consi@@ der@@ ably more user frien@@ dly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the next generation of graphic user inter@@ faces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an appli@@ cation .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and ge@@ st@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ?
if they become more intuitive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intuitive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
that means i can trans@@ fer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consi@@ der@@ ably more user frien@@ dly .
that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance sche@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
it &apos;s the so-@@ called o@@ sit model .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , se@@ lect , in@@ form , trans@@ act .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ ctively in part .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
o@@ sit in itself is used by us fif@@ ty to sev@@ enty thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ cer@@ ta@@ ined that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , se@@ lect , in@@ form , trans@@ act to an interaction system .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the de@@ sk@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user fri@@ end@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the de@@ sk@@ top .
and if i now trans@@ fer this , if i let ori@@ ent take shape as an over@@ view , se@@ lect as a selection , in@@ form in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , trans@@ act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the sh@@ op@@ ping , etc . ,
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in .
i get the entire over@@ view , can fil@@ ter this and can say , now show me all the things with chocol@@ ate , for example .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consi@@ der@@ ably more intuitive and natural .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acces@@ sible via hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ically organ@@ is@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechan@@ isms so to speak .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
i &apos;d like to re@@ introduce you to a particular aspect of curi@@ osity .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your pot@@ ty and sti@@ r its cont@@ ents , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
and curi@@ osity can &apos;t be learned .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a character@@ istic that can &apos;t be learned .
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , for@@ ty years of the-@@ clu@@ b@@ -@@ of-@@ ro@@ me , into quality .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
and that has to do with p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us .
give pe@@ e a chance .
every day you release + you release in the region of two gra@@ ms of p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us and every day you have to absor@@ b two gra@@ ms of p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in the earth &apos;s se@@ as as am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous mo@@ ll@@ us@@ cs .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absor@@ b and release p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
we are depen@@ dent on two countries .
we only have p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us for two years and p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing worldwide is already em@@ itting a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last tw@@ enty years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand ton@@ n@@ es of ur@@ ani@@ um was put onto our fields in germany .
and we absor@@ b all of it .
it causes le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
protect the environment , produce less ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh .
protect the environment , consu@@ me less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ dle to the gra@@ ve , then our our entire planet will become a ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y so@@ on@@ er or later .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ dle to cra@@ dle .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the ground sto@@ res over six@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
at the moment we &apos;re growing cor@@ n and losing between ele@@ ven and thir@@ ty ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms thir@@ ty ton@@ n@@ es per he@@ ct@@ are , if you were to calcul@@ ate it per square me@@ t@@ re .
that means we &apos;re losing five-@@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and everything is either the pack@@ aging or the cont@@ ents .
in off@@ en@@ b@@ ach , for example , tw@@ enty percent of the amount of waste produced by house@@ holds consi@@ sts of na@@ pp@@ ies .
and as we get older , the na@@ pp@@ ies get bigger .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-@@ na@@ pp@@ y stage , so to speak .
right ?
one a baby needs about si@@ x-@@ thousand na@@ pp@@ ies .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
china can make up for that in one second .
it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant .
so the question is , how should we deal with na@@ pp@@ ies ?
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pi@@ gs .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
because with pi@@ gs , p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us is released in their solid components fa@@ e@@ ces .
with people , it is released in the ur@@ ine .
yes .
so humans can &apos;t be pi@@ gs .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
tradi@@ tionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become gr@@ ab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so you have someone like al g@@ ore , one of our great heroes , saying : there is nothing more important than st@@ abi@@ li@@ sing the human population .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants we@@ i@@ gh four times as much a people .
i could also mention ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the us@@ a nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
so ants we@@ i@@ gh more than we do .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thir@@ ty billion people .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why off@@ en@@ b@@ ach , for example , has a program to be climate neutr@@ al by tw@@ enty for@@ ty , right ?
you can only be climate neutr@@ al if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
that &apos;s your only chance .
have you ever seen a climate neutr@@ al tree ?
have you ?
just one single one ?
that means our entire intelligence amounts to us wan@@ ting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you see ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutr@@ al .
than@@ k@@ fully , right ?
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amaz@@ on forest alone .
of those have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
so all of our intelligence amounts to us wan@@ ting to be du@@ mber than trees .
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own me@@ tabo@@ lic waste to be re@@ turned .
every year we lose about three ton@@ n@@ es of p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated .
and so there are too many of us .
just because of that .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no nat@@ u@@ re-@@ e@@ t-@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ m@@ its our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
but where are we of use ?
we try to mini@@ mi@@ ze our eco@@ logical foot@@ print , but the point is to have a big foot@@ print that &apos;s of use .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
zero emissions , you see ?
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutri@@ ents .
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
in in china a a cha@@ mber po@@ t is still called a hon@@ ey po@@ t , you could say , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is character@@ ized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places .
that &apos;s why all western empi@@ res just kept on exp@@ anding until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imp@@ lo@@ ded .
you see ?
it was different in china .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me@@ al until you need to use the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ frien@@ dly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bio@@ gas , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fav@@ el@@ as , a far@@ mer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chic@@ k@@ ens and pi@@ gs and duc@@ ks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fav@@ el@@ as goes down by over n@@ ine@@ ty percent .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
that &apos;s high-@@ tech agriculture of course , but the p@@ lots take care of themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a far@@ mer can farm them easily .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and none of these p@@ lots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fif@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ enty years , none of these p@@ lots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ aged .
it would be easy to just throw a lit@@ re of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
so we must get the p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most su@@ itable pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is the one in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t .
unfortunately not the one on off@@ en@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the fran@@ k@@ fur@@ ters a hand .
because the plant in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t would be the best at win@@ ning back p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us .
and it must go back .
we can see that p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we can see that it can be done .
in hol@@ land we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us .
but we need this everywhere .
you see , there are two countries that control almost sev@@ enty percent of the p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide .
there &apos;s the o@@ pe@@ c , a a bunch of am@@ ate@@ urs .
it consi@@ sts of tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six member countries that control for@@ ty percent of all the oil de@@ pos@@ its .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed by other energy sources .
but p@@ hosp@@ hor@@ us will not be able to be re@@ placed .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
so it &apos;s about effe@@ c@@ tivity , not efficiency .
in hol@@ land it &apos;s easier to understand this , because hol@@ land built the country on flowers .
you see ?
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up@@ set her , and you turn up with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
totally ine@@ ffici@@ ent .
but totally effective , right ?
or take li@@ p@@ stick .
a woman in germany s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws about six point three ki@@ los of li@@ p@@ stick in her lifetime .
whereas .
and that scienti@@ fically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li@@ p@@ stick is totally ine@@ ffici@@ ent , but very effective , you see ?
a all the beautiful things in life are ine@@ ffici@@ ent .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effe@@ c@@ tivity .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
not burning the bio@@ soli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cy@@ cles in the in@@ cin@@ er@@ ation plant , but asking one@@ self , how do you close cy@@ cles ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art being efficient .
right ?
if i inv@@ ite you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a p@@ ill with off@@ en@@ b@@ ach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that means that everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , reduc@@ ing .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environ@@ ment@@ ally aware .
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
every foot@@ print is disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ geous there .
when you go running , right , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
because the soil will the mo@@ ss dies and the the wind and water was@@ h away the soil .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water will remain in the field for longer .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large foot@@ print , which will turn into we@@ t@@ land .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
we say sustainability in germany .
right ?
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
what would you say ?
sustainable .
then i would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
that &apos;s just about the min@@ im@@ um .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding .
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in it@@ al@@ y throw out a can of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a from their car window .
that &apos;s a funny oc@@ curr@@ ence , you know .
it &apos;s a type of terr@@ it@@ ori@@ al behavior , right ?
you can show that you were there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ de@@ gra@@ ded , wherever it is .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contribu@@ ting to bio@@ diversity .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not har@@ m@@ ful .
so two cy@@ cles are created .
of course not everything should be compos@@ table .
a tv or a wa@@ shing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
only things that are subject to wear and te@@ ar , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings , car ty@@ res , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
right ?
let &apos;s take s@@ ne@@ a@@ kers for example , right ?
direct adverti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to help this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
right ?
so if i inv@@ ite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
posi@@ tively .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it .
everything that &apos;s inside can be u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed .
these are the first shoes with which you make a j@@ ack@@ rab@@ bit start at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an lights and the ru@@ b@@ ber so@@ le can go into biological cy@@ cles , okay ?
it &apos;s all compos@@ table all of it .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adi@@ d@@ as , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ n@@ es and ma@@ ur@@ it@@ z and the whole tex@@ tile industry .
and half of the wa@@ ste@@ water problem worldwide is caused by the tex@@ tile industry .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you are you really serious ?
because they changed their cha@@ ir@@ man of the board of dire@@ ctors twice now .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
so give me a hand here .
it is possible though .
yes .
that which i just presen@@ ted to you .
it &apos;s possible .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and te@@ ar , when they break , they can go into biological life cy@@ cles .
there are also technical cy@@ cles .
there &apos;s the a direct re@@ turning system for this .
it &apos;s the first biological r@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ ack , truly , that was made to be re@@ turned into the life cycle .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
if you think about it , right ?
remember those na@@ pp@@ ies again ?
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
these na@@ pp@@ ies are everywhere prac@@ tically .
in those countries where people have money .
they &apos;re on the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh ti@@ ps , but also el@@ se@@ where in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water t@@ ank , inside , so they can go back to a cel@@ lu@@ lose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fif@@ ty trees in israel or t@@ uni@@ sia with one baby .
right ?
if you just take these these na@@ pp@@ ies , sh@@ red them , steri@@ li@@ ze them and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees with it .
that makes the baby carb@@ on-@@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neutr@@ al , we can be cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ positive .
it &apos;s about making a benef@@ icial poo@@ p print .
yes , so to speak .
right ?
we can do that .
we can re-@@ invent things all over again .
i foun@@ ded an institute with this in mind .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s also an extra associ@@ ation , the cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ le-@@ institute , where everybody can get involved .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding , reduc@@ ing , no more gu@@ il@@ t management , but intelligent waste .
does that make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
music as language .
in the descri@@ ption of my presentation , it is written that i , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a transl@@ ator , in the english sense of the word .
interpre@@ ters are transl@@ ators of the written notes in res@@ ounding music .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl@@ ator can &apos;t just simply ren@@ der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful trans@@ lation can occur .
transl@@ ating from german into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the trans@@ lation of literature or even poetry .
what we musici@@ ans do with our musical language is very ali@@ en to non-@@ profes@@ sion@@ als .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
now you probably think that the compos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they &apos;ve thought of .
in reality the notes are very vag@@ ue and im@@ preci@@ se .
these notes are about as preci@@ se or im@@ preci@@ se as the ver@@ bal descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely preci@@ se .
because you can &apos;t smell the flowers in the ver@@ bal descri@@ ption of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing of the wind .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must trans@@ late these im@@ preci@@ se indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , concrete , non-@@ ver@@ bal musical language .
today i &apos;d like to ver@@ b@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late into music , or interpre@@ t .
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ fer to do it all in german , because if i &apos;d have to trans@@ late it into english , that would be like the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
the so , music functions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opinion .
the an@@ no@@ t@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a viol@@ in string .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it pas@@ si@@ vely or whether you can also ac@@ tively speak it , all the way to the musical native spea@@ ker .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
once you &apos;ve selec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the com@@ position &apos;s creation .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dary literature .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were ex@@ pressed by the compos@@ er themselves .
you study works that have been com@@ posed before or after .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
the reasons for writing it .
how and what did they feel ?
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
all that interests me .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surr@@ ounding the compos@@ er as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them reg@@ ularly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the compos@@ er .
the compos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
as the note is anything but a preci@@ se indi@@ cation of the desire of a compos@@ er , and is , rather , a framework , i will now u@@ ti@@ li@@ se this framework to fill it with sense and meaning .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
i play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the compos@@ er at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
every note , every phrase is th@@ us given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i &apos;ve personally experienced .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
it always makes for a happy concer@@ t when i have the fortun@@ e to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in adv@@ ance .
it &apos;s like experi@@ encing a happy new day af@@ re@@ sh , even though you go through the same r@@ itu@@ als , getting up , having break@@ fast , going to work , i experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
i &apos;m a day older , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se is s@@ lower in the evening than it is in the morning , in a concer@@ t hall it takes longer for the rever@@ ber@@ ation to return than it does at home .
i &apos;m aware of the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all this influ@@ ences me and influ@@ ences my experience of the com@@ position .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul@@ ating conversation .
you introduce a new idea and this is answer@@ ed inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communi@@ ca@@ tes in a li@@ vely way .
in this way , every concer@@ t is a different concer@@ t .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in tw@@ enty years .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical pal@@ et@@ te will have many more nu@@ ances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
sure , i will have thro@@ wn some colors away too , but i will have added new ones to take their place .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustr@@ ate this .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my be@@ loved old teacher professor j@@ ü@@ r@@ gen u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , concer@@ t pi@@ ani@@ st and lon@@ g@@ standing professor at the conser@@ v@@ atory here in stu@@ tt@@ g@@ art .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir@@ te@@ en , and so i always atten@@ ded his cour@@ ses while i was at school .
i was seven@@ te@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in &apos;s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works .
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this bal@@ la@@ d was in my opinion .
it &apos;s a so@@ le@@ m@@ n part .
and , being young , i said , expec@@ tation .
he s@@ mil@@ ed and said , oh ?
that must be our difference in age .
because to me it means memory .
he was over six@@ ty at the time .
well , at seven@@ te@@ en you still have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
another example from a very different field . mon@@ et pain@@ ted his water@@ li@@ lies an infinite number of times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
he transl@@ ated the water@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
his personal im@@ pres@@ sions of the water@@ li@@ lies .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the u@@ mp@@ teen@@ th time is compar@@ able in this way .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in when he wrote the piece at thir@@ ty@@ -@@ two .
he only lived until the age of thir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
to main@@ tain the di@@ alo@@ gue , directly with the compos@@ er .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
beg@@ in@@ ners &apos; classes har@@ dly talk about interpre@@ tation .
well , so it says pres@@ to at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
len@@ to , slow .
the lou@@ d and soft sy@@ mb@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
most people here have heard of them .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just remains something technical .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpre@@ tation .
i &apos;m surprised .
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very ele@@ mentary .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in adv@@ ance .
which is singing .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ on@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
people who have never sun@@ g con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one .
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
the music instrument is an exten@@ sion of our own body .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fingers .
the me@@ lo@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being sun@@ g and rhyth@@ m is created through dance .
the constant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very benef@@ icial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bo@@ red .
you no longer need to whist@@ le or sing a song .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use these little mus@@ cles that at@@ tun@@ e the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds .
because you can train that .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ itable .
then my question is , how profes@@ sion@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nic@@ ely now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys ?
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
which i would very much regre@@ t , because music is a lovely , communi@@ ca@@ tive thing .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hope@@ less can@@ di@@ date .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ sta@@ in from food just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ sta@@ in from listening to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether you like its taste or not .
whether the music is too pe@@ p@@ per@@ y or sweet for your taste .
say what you feel .
with time , you will have deman@@ ds and will want to have more sp@@ ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen ac@@ tively ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
a work of art that is never looked at will never ga@@ ther the strength to have an effect .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the reci@@ pe for it .
so please listen when music is played .
it is not only a nice w@@ all@@ paper made of noise .
when a child grows up in an environment where the adults ac@@ tively make music or at least ac@@ tively list@@ ens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and it will sound completely different from before .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
so the first step towards an interpre@@ tation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
instruments have developed .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as the piano in b@@ ach &apos;s time .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
i think b@@ ach would have been very en@@ thu@@ si@@ astic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pi@@ an@@ os have .
i can make b@@ ach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a bar@@ o@@ que har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d was not able to .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven we know that he list@@ ened more once he &apos;d already gone dea@@ f .
today a modern orchestr@@ a can play anything that was re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ play@@ able at the time .
that &apos;s why compos@@ ers depend on us interpre@@ ters to re@@ invent the pieces again and again .
so that what they had only con@@ ju@@ red up in their minds becomes list@@ enable .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what en@@ vy is ?
were you ever envi@@ ous ?
and how did you feel ?
terrible .
i have a friend who drives a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
when i turn up in my little v@@ w cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
something sho@@ ots through my head .
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s un@@ fair .
it goes against justice .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
our organism has come up with an excell@@ ent method to make un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappe@@ ar .
you can also try it with words like reven@@ ge or acqui@@ si@@ tiv@@ eness and the like .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acces@@ sible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall .
and then they start p@@ iling up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked .
a lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something entirely different in mind .
he &apos;s only de@@ cei@@ ving you and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re de@@ cei@@ ving yourself .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self-@@ de@@ ception , up@@ right .
this is harder to check or bring down .
you need time .
an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ e you might know talks about this time .
the sp@@ an@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ lo pi@@ ca@@ s@@ so once pain@@ ted a portra@@ it of a woman .
the woman then compla@@ ined that the portra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her .
pi@@ ca@@ s@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
it will start to look more and more like you .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
then that un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ di@@ ose invention to st@@ abi@@ li@@ ze our living conditions .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ tho@@ logy , in stories .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at her@@ self in the mirror every day and said , who is the fa@@ i@@ rest of them all ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fa@@ i@@ re@@ r than you .
over the h@@ ills and all that .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ l@@ ity ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political corre@@ ct@@ ness here .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bi@@ shop of wor@@ ce@@ ster .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the ori@@ gin of species and the de@@ sc@@ ent of man .
that humans are supposed to have de@@ sc@@ ended from ap@@ es and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ st@@ or shared by both humans and ap@@ es .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what charles has written is not true .
that the human de@@ sc@@ ended from ap@@ es and we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
because we want this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , de@@ sc@@ ended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predict@@ able as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s un@@ be@@ ar@@ able for us .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
to show you how slowly this mechan@@ ism disappe@@ ars and to illustr@@ ate the trac@@ es it leaves , which lead to something other than this gran@@ di@@ ose image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
my wife told me it .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the ten@@ den@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
and because i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence .
a young la@@ d like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fi@@ res .
he &apos;s interested in setting fi@@ res .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
and mo@@ re@@ over , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fi@@ res and are happy when the fire f@@ lar@@ es up .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the danger that others create when they set a fire .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
this this h@@ int at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out lou@@ d .
here you have the cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which swit@@ ches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political corre@@ ct@@ ness .
we know that something else is really true .
but we know that if we were to say that out lou@@ d , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
according to which logic do we dis@@ se@@ minate this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , this wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ?
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustr@@ ate this .
the first example works with the pre@@ su@@ mption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
i &apos;m talking about the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something mental , le@@ i@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an in@@ cor@@ po@@ real framework around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of fle@@ sh and blood , are solid , so to speak , b@@ ound to the earth , e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an air@@ y nature , it &apos;s called anim@@ a in la@@ tin , being like a breath of air .
and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with di@@ gn@@ ity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul .
and then it can leave you .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a logic to us .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness to lie .
na@@ mely to lie in such a way that you can simply imple@@ ment this logic in the wrong way .
this rule of three con@@ tains three the@@ ore@@ ms .
the first the@@ ore@@ m is , k@@ la@@ us cla@@ ims there is no soul .
the second the@@ ore@@ m is th@@ us , if k@@ la@@ us is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now we have the third the@@ ore@@ m .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
a third the@@ ore@@ m which will turn up in people who have a strong att@@ ach@@ ment to the idea of a soul .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
so you sense it already .
here this logic is ex@@ pressed in this de@@ cep@@ tive disc@@ our@@ se .
you see it straight away .
the first two the@@ ore@@ ms are logically correct .
i can claim anything .
logic does not make any state@@ ments about reality .
i can say , the german chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man .
logic does not make any statement about what is val@@ id .
i can claim anything .
what is deci@@ sive , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s val@@ id .
so when k@@ la@@ us says , there is no soul .
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
so it att@@ aches a third the@@ ore@@ m to it , that has nothing to do with the first two the@@ ore@@ ms and only acts as if the opposite of the first the@@ ore@@ m had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two the@@ ore@@ ms are logically correct and att@@ aches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can apply these things to other examples .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ ate@@ dly an ite@@ m in the daily newsp@@ a@@ pers .
here you have to keep another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a philosop@@ hi@@ cal s@@ low-@@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ teen@@ th
century .
there was a scho@@ lar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s as@@ s was named after him .
bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s as@@ s is an as@@ s that is made pu@@ rely of nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ y@@ st@@ acks , it will star@@ ve .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack it should go to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imag@@ ined .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ nat@@ ures will can@@ ce@@ l each other out .
nothing will happen .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determin@@ ed by the larger ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that immediately attrac@@ ts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we &apos;re here in fran@@ k@@ fur@@ t am main , i &apos;ll remind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scho@@ lar there , his name is w@@ ol@@ f sin@@ ger , and sometimes people say , w@@ ol@@ f sin@@ ger cla@@ ims , there is no free will .
now we can come up with the second the@@ ore@@ m and say : if w@@ ol@@ f sin@@ ger is right , then he has no free will .
these the@@ ore@@ ms are absolutely logical and correct .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third the@@ ore@@ m .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ ims and is th@@ us of un@@ sound mind .
here you have it again .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
but the logic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first the@@ ore@@ m were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any proof .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predi@@ ctors .
and don &apos;t use the german word for predi@@ ctors , which would be pro@@ ph@@ et .
you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little poli@@ tically in@@ correct .
say , there are no predi@@ ctors .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predi@@ ctors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
because while you are busy telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predi@@ ctors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s de@@ cei@@ ved you .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the necess@@ ity to prove that there are predi@@ ctors .
so through this mo@@ de of pas@@ sing on the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving something you are experi@@ encing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
and if you have another opportunity to en@@ act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don &apos;t remind them of their self-@@ de@@ ception .
thank you for your attention .
yes , hel@@ lo .
i took the liber@@ ty i asked li@@ l@@ ly , if it would be okay to mention her .
she &apos;s one of the organiz@@ ers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wit@@ ne@@ ssed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
i probably be@@ long , are those two frien@@ dly girls still here , i probably be@@ long to the generation that created this bad eco@@ logical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en sev@@ enty nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mid-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study renew@@ able ener@@ gies and they didn &apos;t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ f@@ en nuclear research plant .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ li@@ ch was also called a k@@ f@@ a .
today they &apos;re called project execu@@ ting organizations .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ d@@ ul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred wat@@ t per square me@@ t@@ re , that was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin there was this crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ f@@ t-@@ wing was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties .
at that time , there were self-@@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in k@@ re@@ u@@ z@@ berg in me@@ h@@ rin@@ gh@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
a terrori@@ st place , but it was was called w@@ u@@ sel@@ tr@@ oni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mid-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice state@@ ments were made , which i also was part of .
i worked in the collective for ele@@ ven years , it was based on a gra@@ ss@@ roots democracy .
we were a group of tw@@ enty people .
if one person said no , there was the ve@@ to principle , which was totally de@@ mor@@ al@@ is@@ ing , for ten years , i i had gra@@ ve doub@@ ts as to whether i was perhaps really wa@@ sting my great engineering degree on something ridicul@@ ous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .
he &apos;s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these pha@@ ses just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand de@@ u@@ t@@ sch@@ mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni@@ form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en n@@ ine@@ ty six and then i became the co-@@ foun@@ der of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedi@@ cate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introduce to you .
the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island gr@@ aci@@ o@@ sa on a@@ zo@@ res .
yes , here is the data .
four and a half thousand people live there .
they have a renew@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent at the moment .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because techno@@ logically it &apos;s just not possible .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ l@@ er@@ sh@@ of .
they then also say , why ?
we have tw@@ enty percent in germany .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the european one .
if we had tw@@ enty percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
the question is just , calcul@@ ate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even sev@@ enty percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electrical out@@ put on di@@ e@@ sel fuel basis is added in the world per year .
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly .
the world &apos;s hun@@ ger for energy that we are seeing is reli@@ ev@@ ed with di@@ e@@ sel fuel , because you don &apos;t need a licen@@ se for it .
it goes fast .
you put a box like this over there .
and that generally looks like this .
in it , there are always three di@@ e@@ sels running , two are always main@@ ta@@ ined .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
we were given very accurate data .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quanti@@ ties .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay ,
the di@@ e@@ sel will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies , you have to switch off di@@ e@@ sel .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renew@@ able ener@@ gies can take over the entire network .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ l@@ er@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
that is do@@ able .
but if you want to ho@@ ok up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to construc@@ t a network , it becomes highly complicated .
and our ai@@ m was , we wanted to reach sev@@ enty to n@@ ine@@ ty percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ enty percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from batter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ ri@@ er which will be hydrogen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ on@@ al reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ m@@ ill electro@@ chemical battery .
how far would you get with that ?
and then we tried out a whole load of si@@ mu@@ lations .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ enty years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about for@@ ty@@ -@@ four cents .
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
and then we said , okay ,
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re chea@@ per than the di@@ e@@ sel system , if the price of di@@ e@@ sel ri@@ ses by five percent a year .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the is@@ land@@ ers .
what needed to be done ?
we negoti@@ ated with inve@@ stors , i looked for new sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the organ@@ i@@ sation .
and here you have the graphic again .
the brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ enty percent di@@ e@@ sel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and the power u@@ til@@ ity , which which the electric u@@ til@@ ity on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could preci@@ sely re@@ construc@@ t , so to speak , the electrical ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the bb@@ c man@@ n@@ he@@ im , called ab@@ b today , in the sev@@ enti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the japanese .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical si@@ mulation .
and then presen@@ ted .
we also brought one of these di@@ e@@ sel aggre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the di@@ e@@ sel is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simul@@ ate the network .
over here we simul@@ ate the entire trans@@ mission gu@@ id@@ ance system , the cable &apos;s kilome@@ ter physics , to illustr@@ ate the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred ki@@ lo@@ wat@@ t + to the network .
we can see it again here we can see the di@@ e@@ sel again here , and all the individual aggre@@ gates here .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and tw@@ el@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything that could be developed electr@@ on@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
you have to be able to ca@@ ter for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renew@@ able ener@@ gies .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five-@@ thir@@ ty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to lim@@ it the wind and sun .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mo@@ bility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
that means that if you &apos;re at sev@@ enty percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ari@@ se .
if we turn off the di@@ e@@ sel , then you will no longer have this rot@@ ating mass , which causes a certain amount of id@@ l@@ eness in the network .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of rot@@ ating ma@@ sses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always rev@@ ol@@ ves around the whole of europe .
we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ t@@ z , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ t@@ z , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more stea@@ m can enter , and then it goes up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the sp@@ inning re@@ serve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently .
if you don &apos;t have this rot@@ ating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electr@@ onics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milli@@ seconds .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rot@@ ating ma@@ sses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ enty , tw@@ enty , tw@@ enty percent , tw@@ enty , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
and then we have to decre@@ ase our mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties in the network .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al-@@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ b@@ ines , because that &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re just trying to demonstr@@ ate that we can decre@@ ase the capac@@ i@@ ties , the mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
than@@ k@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried out on this topic .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experim@@ ental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
and yes , the discussion always rev@@ ol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
and many discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir@@ ty years re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s non@@ sense , a play@@ thing for kids , we calcul@@ ated everything , it will never add up .
we have thir@@ ty gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ t of photo@@ -@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic power in germany .
that &apos;s ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
and i simply assu@@ me that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thir@@ ty years .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
there will be a whole load of resistance and argu@@ ments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been jo@@ ining my side in the last couple of years .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million fun@@ ded projects , also to att@@ ach a ten@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t battery to the german network .
that will take place next a@@ pri@@ l .
so you &apos;re notic@@ ing a change is taking place , from a defen@@ sive at@@ titude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies is right .
and when you have one hundred percent renew@@ able ener@@ gies , then it &apos;s like a self-@@ su@@ ffici@@ ent system .
up till now the following is always argu@@ ed in discus@@ sions , these is@@ land@@ ers are becoming self-@@ su@@ ffici@@ ent , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our jo@@ int network .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are dri@@ lled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and that is kind of our vision of sen@@ sible energy use and i am gr@@ ate@@ ful to the cra@@ dle to cra@@ dle institute that they said , use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming together , also if you look at the presentation by pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that it &apos;s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motiv@@ ate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while doing so , but i think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
thank you .
one day , los angel@@ es times colum@@ ni@@ st steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angel@@ es when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ gged , home@@ less , playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ r@@ . acting as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ i@@ el an@@ th@@ ony a@@ yers , the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bas@@ si@@ st whose promi@@ sing career was cut short by a tra@@ gic a@@ ff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el dropped out of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living home@@ less on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angel@@ es .
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that b@@ ond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ than@@ i@@ el get off the streets .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concer@@ t hall .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ y@@ o ma and hil@@ lar@@ y clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first viol@@ in pas@@ sage work in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ i@@ el was interested in a viol@@ in lesson with me .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ i@@ el ref@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that s@@ car has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fe@@ st themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wan@@ dering the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ rors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ lea@@ shed upon him .
and na@@ than@@ i@@ el was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concer@@ t hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if i started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven viol@@ in concer@@ to .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ than@@ i@@ el &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its ca@@ tal@@ y@@ st .
and na@@ than@@ i@@ el &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was transformed into understanding , a quiet curi@@ osity and gr@@ ace .
and in a mirac@@ le , he li@@ fted his own viol@@ in and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts of viol@@ in concer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ beli@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms , br@@ uc@@ k@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to e@@ sa@@ -@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ on@@ en .
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angel@@ es phil@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angel@@ es to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ d@@ ite , brilliant , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musici@@ an .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for na@@ than@@ i@@ el , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and de@@ lu@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ mented state .
and i understood that this was the very ess@@ ence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression re@@ aches all of us and moves us , inspi@@ res and un@@ ites us .
and for na@@ than@@ i@@ el , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musici@@ ans that understood him , that recogn@@ ized his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ i@@ el , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concer@@ t hall or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musici@@ an .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sha@@ me@@ less@@ ly sto@@ le from cel@@ li@@ sts .
so , please for@@ give me .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate a@@ ff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ v@@ or@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ raised to the supposed highest stand@@ ards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
n@@ ine@@ ty percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it : fish far@@ ms pollu@@ te -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re ine@@ ffici@@ ent . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentr@@ ated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head bio@@ logist .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken pe@@ l@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken pe@@ l@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , scra@@ ps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pa@@ use on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , goo@@ d@@ y-@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i sw@@ ear to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern sp@@ ain .
a journ@@ alist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
like twice over .
amaz@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ ci@@ ous .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a bio@@ logist at ve@@ ta la pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of sp@@ ain .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
they raised be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
they built this intri@@ cate series of can@@ als , and they pu@@ shed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
and eco@@ logically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a sp@@ an@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ cha@@ sed the land .
what did they do ?
they rever@@ sed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of pu@@ shing water out , they used the chan@@ ne@@ ls to pull water back in .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- bas@@ s , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely rever@@ sed the eco@@ logical destruction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you st@@ are out at a horiz@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
okay ? there we are s@@ log@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my kne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare black@@ -@@ shoul@@ dered k@@ ite .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tioning the min@@ eral needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tan@@ z@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qua@@ tic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ plu@@ gged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ ci@@ ous fish i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom@@ as@@ s , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ rene@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we r@@ ounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fla@@ min@@ gos , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pet for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re fe@@ a@@ sting . &quot;
fe@@ a@@ sting ? i was totally conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ a@@ sting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 00,000 birds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
this is an eco@@ logical network .
the fla@@ min@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measu@@ res its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
oh , and by the way , those fla@@ min@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no kid@@ ding .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a wh@@ it@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my be@@ loved fish , which was deli@@ ci@@ ous -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ; i don &apos;t like it sear@@ ed , i don &apos;t like it cri@@ sp@@ y .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , tar@@ -like fla@@ vor .
i almost never cook with it .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern sp@@ ain , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted sweet and clean , like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything en@@ ters the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measu@@ res its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big underst@@ ate@@ ment , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical conta@@ min@@ ants , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de ru@@ no@@ ff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean@@ er than when it enter@@ ed .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measu@@ res its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mps out into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instruc@@ tive .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new con@@ ception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ st@@ es good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not re@@ alists , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love p@@ ink fla@@ min@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ qu@@ alities in distribution , not ton@@ n@@ age .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people more chea@@ p@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motiv@@ ation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding eco@@ logical capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is threat@@ ened today , not because of di@@ mini@@ shing supply , but because of di@@ mini@@ shing resources .
not by the latest combine and trac@@ tor invention , but by fer@@ tile land ; not by pu@@ mps , but by fresh water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and ne@@ ts , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the eco@@ logical model .
that &apos;s the one that re@@ lies on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ ci@@ ous .
thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality char@@ t organized by age .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , acci@@ dents .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
this is because , in the mid-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organiz@@ e the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual su@@ spe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single s@@ ports illustr@@ ated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in this issue , the s@@ ports .
i &apos;m a l@@ ance ar@@ m@@ strong f@@ an , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which l@@ ance ar@@ m@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cyc@@ ling ? &quot;
so i can step back , and expand on that .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mon@@ d now .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , broad@@ er , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not sear@@ ching , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mary .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and se@@ lect government .
now , having selec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia cate@@ gor@@ ies that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not conta@@ ined within any one wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win@@ ners .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstr@@ action .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic sear@@ ching , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just launch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up on a stea@@ dy diet of science fic@@ tion .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fic@@ tion book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satis@@ fied , in a narrative form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fe@@ sted itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the micro@@ scope .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possibility .
and my love of science fic@@ tion actually seemed mir@@ ro@@ red in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
jac@@ ques cou@@ stea@@ u was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ d@@ rou@@ s world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this satur@@ ation of c@@ g movies and all of this imag@@ ery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw ali@@ en creatures , ali@@ en worlds , robots , spac@@ e@@ ships , all that stuff .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the tex@@ t@@ book .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ stea@@ u shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ e@@ ship some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ are@@ st ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ un@@ t me .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a y@@ m@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so boun@@ d@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and my love a@@ ff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i chose a career as an adult , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fic@@ tion stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of underwater and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually emb@@ rac@@ ed computer generated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
and this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- b@@ arely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ ne@@ ssed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was me@@ sm@@ er@@ ized by this ap@@ parent magic .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur clar@@ ke &apos;s law that any su@@ ffici@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from magic .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be emb@@ rac@@ ed into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with stan w@@ inst@@ on , my good friend stan w@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analo@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves la@@ gging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually foun@@ ded the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ velo@@ pe of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with real@@ istic human emo@@ tive characters generated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
and the en@@ velo@@ pe pu@@ shed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ li@@ et &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
and i talked them into funding an expe@@ di@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a rus@@ sian sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of resc@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fic@@ tion movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , i really got bit@@ ten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean exploration .
of course , the curi@@ osity , the science component of it -- it was everything . it was adv@@ enture , it was curi@@ osity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hol@@ lywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expe@@ di@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
so , i was completely sm@@ it@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hol@@ lywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explo@@ re@@ r for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these and we w@@ ound up going to the bi@@ smar@@ k , and exploring it with robo@@ tic vehicles .
we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
we took little bots that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
i felt like i was physically present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ presence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ v@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is in@@ je@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an .
so , having done these expe@@ di@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
they live in an environment of che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fic@@ tion influence , as a kid .
and i w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y board , planning actual space missions , going to russia , going through the pre-@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i w@@ ound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- a@@ stro@@ bio@@ logists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making docu@@ mentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expe@@ di@@ tions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
we b@@ arely break even . there is no fa@@ me in it .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these docu@@ mentary films for a very limited audience .
no fa@@ me , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the atten@@ tu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a b@@ ond , creates a b@@ ond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terr@@ it@@ ory , doing &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four-@@ and-@@ half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we syn@@ the@@ size out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fe@@ st a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ re@@ ls in the world .
i have young fil@@ m@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put lim@@ it@@ ations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
nasa has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
and no important en@@ dea@@ vor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cines and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poo@@ rest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gile environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certainty , it leads to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it chea@@ per -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ re@@ ct effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certainty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high tr@@ uck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ oxide every year , over 2@@ 6 billion tons .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s hea@@ ded up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ compas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street la@@ mps .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , or how we do air trans@@ port , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a reduc@@ tion of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 2@@ 6 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renew@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mirac@@ les .
now , when i use the term &quot; mirac@@ le , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mirac@@ le . the personal computer is a mirac@@ le .
the internet and its services are a mirac@@ le .
so , the people here have particip@@ ated in the creation of many mirac@@ les .
usually , we don &apos;t have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the mirac@@ le by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mirac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosqu@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosqu@@ it@@ os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fi@@ ref@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mic@@ ky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fu@@ sion , bio@@ fuels .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ e@@ ing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often ref@@ er to as the renew@@ able sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ges .
one is that the density of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ matically less than a power plant .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , like@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
and , to dimen@@ sion@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for fla@@ sh@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the appro@@ aches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mirac@@ le battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called es@@ o@@ lar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s inve@@ sting in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
na@@ than my@@ h@@ r@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpri@@ sin@@ gly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mo@@ du@@ lar , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the adv@@ ent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ file .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ actors .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ thes this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often re@@ fer@@ red to as a traveling wave re@@ actor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in ken@@ tu@@ cky .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduc@@ tion .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up fore@@ stry , ce@@ ment .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
so , the other grade is : are we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zero-@@ e@@ mission technology , have we dep@@ loyed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
that &apos;s su@@ per important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measu@@ res to start getting reduc@@ tions : the less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pi@@ lot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al g@@ ore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ u@@ ss the co2 .
they should disc@@ u@@ ss this innovation agen@@ da , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative appro@@ aches .
we do need the market incenti@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this di@@ alo@@ gue be a more rational , more underst@@ and@@ able di@@ alo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a rus@@ sian re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pi@@ lot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always refu@@ eling the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ols or dry ca@@ s@@ king by re@@ actors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ actors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reduc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite dra@@ matically as you &apos;re going through this process .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ lo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agen@@ da .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important adv@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , ti@@ me@@ scale and like@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the dead@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ shing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ z@@ ens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , like@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pi@@ lot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ du@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emer@@ gency measu@@ res to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
b@@ g : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an insur@@ ance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geo@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot s@@ lower than we expect ?
climate ske@@ p@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persu@@ a@@ de them that they &apos;re wrong ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the ske@@ p@@ tics come in different ca@@ mps .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ ints , then the ske@@ p@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s chea@@ per than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reason@@ able people can disa@@ gre@@ e , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy su@@ per expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our life@@ style .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
his sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the ske@@ p@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and so there is a th@@ read of something that i think is appropriate .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
well bill , i su@@ spect i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
b@@ g : thank you .
several years ago here at ted , pe@@ ter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tal@@ lest fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i , one y@@ ard of tape , one y@@ ard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i &apos;ve conduc@@ ted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ en@@ ting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ c@@ key for power .
then they spend some time planning , organiz@@ ing , they ske@@ tch and they lay out sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i .
they spend the majority of their time assemb@@ ling the sticks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they gin@@ ger@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ str@@ acted and they produce really la@@ me structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as pe@@ ter tells us , not only do they produce the tal@@ lest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and pe@@ ter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ cke@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they execu@@ te on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototy@@ pes , suc@@ ces@@ sive prototy@@ pes , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototy@@ pes along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototy@@ pe is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , than@@ k@@ fully .
thir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine in@@ ches is the tal@@ lest structure i &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ cing ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an execu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of fac@@ il@@ itation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
speci@@ alized skills and fac@@ il@@ itation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the win@@ ning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototy@@ ping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tal@@ lest structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incenti@@ ves and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frankly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototy@@ pe .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w@@ chall@@ en@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allows .
there &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step instruc@@ tions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact s@@ port .
it deman@@ ds that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototy@@ pe of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pret@@ end right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , te@@ d-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , de@@ clin@@ ing rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents pu@@ shed that number to 70 .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the ri@@ chest man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
we van@@ qui@@ shed it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that threat@@ ened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , ru@@ bel@@ la , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vac@@ cines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
that number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tra@@ sh this globe .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people wra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ efs , and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cines for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ pha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journ@@ alist .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that &apos;s because those f@@ an@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually f@@ an@@ a@@ tics at all .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , edu@@ cated people , de@@ cent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challeng@@ er , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be ske@@ p@@ tical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of au@@ tism to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mps and ru@@ bel@@ la vaccine shot .
very sc@@ ary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same : no corre@@ lation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docu@@ ments from a government off@@ icial giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s .
disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ha@@ med of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like j@@ en@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link ca@@ u@@ sation and corre@@ lation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , j@@ on@@ as sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terrori@@ st .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vac@@ cines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these fab@@ ulous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pret@@ end it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to wra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re use@@ less .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
i &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system suc@@ ks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely astoni@@ sh@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fra@@ u@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fra@@ u@@ d ; aca@@ i -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fra@@ u@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of h@@ h@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mam@@ mo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
he killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ root , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of nee@@ d@@ less deaths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mind@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic el@@ ite .
it &apos;s an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sels sp@@ r@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of ed@@ en .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ en@@ ting life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dead@@ ening , and it &apos;s preven@@ ting millions of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful . dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff , like ca@@ ssa@@ va for instance .
ca@@ ssa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it suc@@ ks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridicul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sin@@ gu@@ lar food .
this isn &apos;t about rice k@@ ri@@ sp@@ ies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ gly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridicul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ mentary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
i &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my w@@ rist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tism will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that i can shake it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tri@@ ck@@ ery . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ do@@ logically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ rist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my w@@ rist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illu@@ sion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shi@@ fts .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s clin@@ ging there , not by animal magne@@ tism , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
i take this hand away . you give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a research@@ er , so this , to me , was an astoni@@ shing thing .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and st@@ amp a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than t@@ ab@@ lets in any form .
a co@@ lo@@ red cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these do@@ sa@@ ges have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ dle .
right ? a sy@@ rin@@ ge with some in@@ er@@ t -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ er@@ t something , and you in@@ ject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ dle .
and none of it has any real phar@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the nee@@ dle .
this is a seven@@ -@@ in@@ ch ha@@ t@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just steri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my fle@@ sh . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fle@@ sh .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hol@@ lywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this nee@@ dle through to the other side .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fle@@ sh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ mb enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hol@@ lywood special effect .
that &apos;s my fle@@ sh , and i can tw@@ ist that around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the nee@@ dle out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no w@@ ounds .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
this app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as me@@ ssed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-being is .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the foc@@ using illu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affe@@ cts well-being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and-@@ answer se@@ ssion after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tionally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experi@@ encing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experi@@ encing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a rememb@@ ering self , and the rememb@@ ering self is the one that keeps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ encing self and the rememb@@ ering self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the rememb@@ ering self is a story@@ tel@@ ler .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
the stories of the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ...
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ encing self and the rememb@@ ering self .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ encing self of patient a worse off , and you have the rememb@@ ering self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and en@@ dings .
en@@ dings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
now , the experi@@ encing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward : they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psycho@@ logical present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tr@@ ace .
most of them are completely ig@@ no@@ red by the rememb@@ ering self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the rememb@@ ering self keeps for us .
so we have the rememb@@ ering self and the experi@@ encing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , if you have a va@@ cation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week va@@ cation is twice as good as the one-@@ week va@@ cation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the rememb@@ ering self .
for the rememb@@ ering self , a two-@@ week va@@ cation is b@@ arely better than the one-@@ week va@@ cation because there are no new memor@@ ies added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that distin@@ gu@@ i@@ shes a rememb@@ ering self from an experi@@ encing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the rememb@@ ering self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ o@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be cho@@ sen .
the experi@@ encing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the rememb@@ ering self , and you can think of the rememb@@ ering self sort of dra@@ gging the experi@@ encing self through experiences that the experi@@ encing self doesn &apos;t need .
i have that sense that when we go on va@@ cations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on va@@ cations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our rememb@@ ering self .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the rememb@@ ering self .
and when i think about that , i think about a va@@ cation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best va@@ cation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other va@@ cations .
and i probably have consu@@ med my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consu@@ ming memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next va@@ cation , you know that at the end of the va@@ cation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same va@@ cation ?
and if you would choose a different va@@ cation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ di@@ cate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the va@@ cations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ encing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ encing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ encing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the rememb@@ ering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how satis@@ fied or ple@@ ased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distin@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i be@@ long to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been me@@ ssing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ sely this way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ encing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the rememb@@ ering self has been recogn@@ ized in recent years , and there are now effor@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other effor@@ ts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you a sense of the corre@@ lation , the corre@@ lation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty .
you have that much un@@ certainty .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certainty about how happy they are with their experi@@ encing self .
so the corre@@ lation is low .
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other p@@ lea@@ su@@ res , but this is domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well-being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contra@@ st between california and other places , and that contra@@ st , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ encing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the reflec@@ tive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experi@@ encing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be remin@@ ded of how horrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
dan@@ i@@ el ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ encing self .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 6@@ 00,000 , so it &apos;s a large represen@@ ta@@ tive sample -- below an income of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
6@@ 0,000 .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progre@@ ssi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ ore@@ r they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ arely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you miser@@ y , and we can measure that miser@@ y very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the rememb@@ ering self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ dea@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
d@@ k : you know i think that there is reco@@ gni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the reco@@ gni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogn@@ izing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ alu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the rememb@@ ering self or you think of the experi@@ encing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , effor@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inven@@ ting behavioral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it en@@ ta@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , consi@@ dering how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dra@@ matically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portra@@ it by a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classic gam@@ ing emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gency , a little bit of fear , but inten@@ se con@@ cent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of opti@@ mism , and the ey@@ e@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an epi@@ c win is an outcome that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achiev@@ ed it .
it was almost beyond the thre@@ sho@@ ld of imagination .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ ke@@ ley , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel over@@ come , we feel overwhel@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe de@@ pressed , fru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real@@ -@@ world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no une@@ mp@@ loy@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of lev@@ eling up and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one strength , and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us@@ -@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us@@ -@@ 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , collec@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently inve@@ sting in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a research@@ er at car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e mel@@ l@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
so , we have an entire paralle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effor@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent opti@@ mism .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
ur@@ gent opti@@ mism is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combined with the belief that we have a reason@@ able hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ric .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us bad@@ ly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity . i love it .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : epi@@ c meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be att@@ ached to awe@@ -@@ inspiring missions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they are building an epi@@ c story .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hope@@ ful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are inve@@ sting so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ ne@@ ssing what amounts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les . right ?
before we had awe@@ some game contro@@ ll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the kingdom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sev@@ ere fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would ign@@ ore the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape real@@ -@@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an epi@@ c adv@@ enture .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who then led to the ro@@ man empi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have sugge@@ sted that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geo@@ logists have found evidence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the fam@@ ine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
that was the first real@@ -@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of ga@@ me-@@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real@@ -@@ world problems .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ vot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it ex@@ pre@@ sses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o outcome , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
i &apos;m just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news , videos , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is ri@@ oting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pi@@ lo@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a trans@@ forma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an epi@@ c adv@@ enture and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and adv@@ enture for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the ha@@ bits that they learned in this game .
so , for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to ai@@ m higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called super@@ struc@@ t at the institute for the future .
and the pre@@ mi@@ se was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movie .
you know jer@@ ry br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astron@@ au@@ t , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with univer@@ sities all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in skills like local insight , knowledge net@@ working , sustainability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
i would like to inv@@ ite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pri@@ ses to save the world .
so , i &apos;m going to wra@@ p up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pi@@ lots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ powers : bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ric , this feeling of ur@@ gent opti@@ mism and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , i say : let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for it@@ alian wired .
i always keep my the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us han@@ dy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished ed@@ iting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ abled &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
let me read you the en@@ try .
&quot; dis@@ abled , ad@@ je@@ ctive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , help@@ less , use@@ less , w@@ re@@ cked , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ ounded , man@@ g@@ led , la@@ me , mu@@ til@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , wea@@ ken@@ ed , im@@ pot@@ ent , ca@@ str@@ ated , paraly@@ zed , han@@ di@@ ca@@ pped , sen@@ i@@ le , decre@@ p@@ it , la@@ i@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hurt , use@@ less and wea@@ k .
ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i was reading this list out lou@@ d to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ g@@ led , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sa@@ ult from these words un@@ lea@@ shed .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , nee@@ d@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us back then .
i mean , from this en@@ try , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m celebr@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ ven@@ tures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online e@@ di@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth no@@ ting .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this en@@ try .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; who@@ le@@ some . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those values .
our language affe@@ cts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out lou@@ d brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
by ca@@ sually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ dows on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
one such person who opened do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ pon@@ t institute in wil@@ min@@ g@@ ton , de@@ law@@ are .
his name was dr. p@@ iz@@ z@@ u@@ til@@ lo , an it@@ alian american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the ex@@ ception of my physical therapy se@@ s@@ sions .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exerci@@ ses with these th@@ ick , el@@ astic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i ha@@ ted these b@@ ands more than anything -- i ha@@ ted them , had names for them . i ha@@ ted them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exerci@@ ses , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my se@@ ssion -- ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tive and un@@ for@@ giving , these se@@ s@@ sions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ me@@ e , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exerci@@ ses i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spect of being the ri@@ chest fi@@ ve@@ -year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promi@@ sing experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inher@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in posi@@ tions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child .
but , in the previous inst@@ ances of those the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , la@@ ser surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , ti@@ tan@@ ium kne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ e@@ ments for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go ali@@ g@@ n with global groups of their own cho@@ o@@ sing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest as@@ set .
the human ability to adap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming adver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt une@@ asy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
imp@@ lic@@ it in this phrase of &quot; over@@ coming adver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience un@@ sca@@ the@@ d or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pre@@ su@@ med pit@@ falls of a life with pros@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emo@@ tionally or both .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adver@@ sity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to re@@ su@@ me living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there is adver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from adver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a di@@ ss@@ er@@ vice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to adap@@ t .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the sub@@ je@@ ctive socie@@ tal opinion of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ abled .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defin@@ i@@ tions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the pa@@ tho@@ logy itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their po@@ ten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the pa@@ tho@@ logy and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a part@@ nership between those percei@@ ved def@@ ici@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wra@@ pped in the adver@@ sity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming adver@@ sity as it is opening ourselves up to it , emb@@ rac@@ ing it , gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adver@@ sity as natural , consist@@ ent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustr@@ ated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to para@@ phrase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what adver@@ sity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re-@@ imagine adver@@ sity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adver@@ sity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest adver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ i@@ ge person if they existed ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achiev@@ ing nor@@ mal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or po@@ ten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and inv@@ ite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthro@@ po@@ logists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ jury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and use@@ less ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , and i was standing over a bu@@ sh@@ el of tom@@ at@@ oes .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ me@@ e mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physici@@ an had gone on va@@ cation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la bones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether win@@ ning a second grade spe@@ lling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en para@@ de , win@@ ning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my s@@ ports vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ n medical school and her@@ sh@@ ey medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ ate@@ dly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cu@@ m of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pros@@ the@@ tics for fle@@ sh@@ -@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ cy back then .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ dows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ ci@@ al moment , you are educa@@ ting them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; edu@@ cate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the states .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were performing at a-@@ level .
and , of course , the hear@@ t@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
those who were still around in school , be@@ sides the people who had dropped out .
a cru@@ ci@@ al part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cru@@ shed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cru@@ shed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qu@@ alities , we are able to create new re@@ alities and new ways of being .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ teen@@ th-@@ century per@@ sian po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more preci@@ se , more accurate and quic@@ ker .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more st@@ am@@ ina .
would you like to be more attrac@@ tive and self-@@ confi@@ dent ?
how about living longer with good health ?
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always year@@ ned for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about f@@ it@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vity ?
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al topic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
the great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tici@@ st , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky , who was also a comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ant in the rus@@ sian or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ t@@ led &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communi@@ cations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at k@@ ath@@ ry@@ n sch@@ ul@@ t@@ z &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever to you .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all directions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every existing species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demonstr@@ ated a f@@ it@@ ness to its environment .
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we bran@@ ch off of a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic mach@@ in@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can take advantage and comman@@ de@@ er the mach@@ in@@ ery of a common bacter@@ ium to produce the protein of human insul@@ in used to treat diabe@@ tics ?
this is not like human insul@@ in ; this is the same protein that is chemic@@ ally indi@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ries in our gu@@ t more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o asks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gu@@ t is a wonder@@ fully hosp@@ itable environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occa@@ sional inter@@ ru@@ ption of the un@@ inten@@ ded forced rus@@ h to the ex@@ it .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ stion of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms , perhaps as much as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a bri@@ ef measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gr@@ ace note .
that was us .
that also constitu@@ tes the entertainment portion of this talk , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
now when i was a fre@@ sh@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated by the ele@@ g@@ ance and beauty of biology .
i became en@@ a@@ mo@@ red of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sin@@ g@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms come online , things start to change .
sexual re@@ production en@@ ters the picture .
and very importantly , with the introduc@@ tion of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ dable .
in fact , you could say that the inev@@ it@@ ability of the death of our bodies en@@ ters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reason@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doub@@ ts .
i &apos;ve come to understand the s@@ enti@@ ments of george bur@@ ns , who was performing still in l@@ as ve@@ gas well into his 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
he answers the door .
standing before him is a gor@@ geous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for su@@ per sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to realize , as a physici@@ an , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ ct@@ ory , just different .
i was trying to pre@@ serve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster ro@@ ckets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the sea .
i think we would all understand the s@@ enti@@ ment that woo@@ dy all@@ en ex@@ pressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily fav@@ or the lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ lived .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fav@@ or the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ ste@@ st , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution fav@@ ors those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
that is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lic and can survive at the stea@@ m v@@ ent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , have managed to make that a hosp@@ itable environment for them .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
we have reached a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
and the reason@@ ing behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to pre@@ serve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it adap@@ t to us as well as we adap@@ t to it .
and by the way , we im@@ migr@@ ate and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ o@@ lation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
and as far as is@@ o@@ lation goes , when we as a species do colon@@ ize dist@@ ant planets , there will be the is@@ o@@ lation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an enti@@ cing , intri@@ gu@@ ing and frigh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ i@@ ded and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , cho@@ o@@ sing to have more males than fe@@ males .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are cho@@ o@@ sing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eli@@ minate diabe@@ tes or al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eli@@ minate stro@@ ke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ no@@ ld and wil@@ le@@ m ste@@ m@@ mer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desi@@ r@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ no@@ ld calls &quot; dire@@ cted evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the la@@ sk@@ er prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ a@@ ka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to rever@@ t to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insul@@ in in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce im@@ m@@ unity against other viruses .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ental trial going on with vaccine against influ@@ en@@ za that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
what if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a health@@ ier life -- eli@@ minate the diabe@@ tes , eli@@ minate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want health@@ ier children ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
why not have the quick w@@ it of a ken j@@ en@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can au@@ gment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the quick twit@@ ch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
these are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?
or , will we selec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we make a society that is more boring and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ bust and more ver@@ sa@@ tile ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most prof@@ oun@@ dly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
i want you now to imagine a wear@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes wheel@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
we at ber@@ ke@@ ley bi@@ onics call these robots ex@@ o@@ ske@@ let@@ ons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true inte@@ gration of the man and the machine .
but not only that -- it will integr@@ ate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chron@@ ic back in@@ ju@@ ries .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skele@@ ton that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introduce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ ri@@ er .
with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skele@@ ton , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
its flexi@@ ble design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ ag@@ ility movements .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then au@@ g@@ ments my strength and end@@ ur@@ ance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skele@@ ton this year .
so this is for real .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheel@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people es@@ tim@@ ated to be in wheel@@ cha@@ irs worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conserva@@ tive estimate .
we are talking here about , of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes , very young individuals with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the wheel@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduc@@ tion , i must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mo@@ bility .
let me now introduce you to ele@@ gs that is wor@@ n by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ te@@ l that 1@@ 9 years ago was spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 1@@ 9 years until now .
thank you .
am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs set .
it has sen@@ sors .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive , sen@@ sors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her kne@@ e jo@@ ints , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ oth and very natural ga@@ it .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sa@@ ult while down@@ h@@ ill s@@ ki@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
in a split second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my pe@@ l@@ v@@ is .
not long after@@ wards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and that was 1@@ 9 y@@ e@@ as ago .
he ro@@ b@@ bed every oun@@ ce of hope from my being .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ abled me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock climb and even hand@@ cycle .
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have discus@@ sions with you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fi@@ res as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a highly sk@@ il@@ led career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the po@@ uring rain , under an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la , in her pa@@ jam@@ as , b@@ are@@ foot , while her house was in fla@@ mes .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
well , i was next .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house .
i need you to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i sw@@ ear .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went -- up the sta@@ irs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bed@@ room to get a pair of shoes .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met my ne@@ me@@ sis and the preci@@ ous dog by the front door .
we took our tre@@ a@@ su@@ res outside to the home@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sin@@ gly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant effort di@@ sp@@ la@@ yed in saving her home .
the act of kin@@ dness she no@@ ted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ figh@@ ter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ u@@ mental scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gr@@ ace and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achiev@@ ed , or are on their way to achiev@@ ing , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hel@@ lo , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cou@@ sin@@ s .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ g@@ les of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clo@@ se@@ st relative .
that means we all share a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well-@@ known for their aggre@@ ssion .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an emp@@ ha@@ sis of this aspect in our narra@@ tives of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where fat@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ go@@ le@@ se jun@@ gle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the con@@ go is a para@@ do@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ kness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
not surpri@@ sin@@ gly , this destruction also en@@ dan@@ gers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
bu@@ sh@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small sta@@ di@@ um with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and cha@@ os , you can hear hidden laugh@@ ter swa@@ ying the trees .
who are these cou@@ sin@@ s ?
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent , promi@@ sc@@ u@@ ous and bi@@ sexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the k@@ ama su@@ tr@@ a .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing toler@@ ance .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laugh@@ ter , dance and r@@ itual .
play is the glu@@ e that bin@@ ds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i do not mean foot@@ ball .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a cha@@ se game .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
it might be the evolutionary ori@@ gin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the b@@ alls . &quot;
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how play both requires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play &apos;s a sha@@ pe@@ shi@@ f@@ ter .
play &apos;s a sha@@ pe@@ shi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is qui@@ e@@ tly playing with water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boun@@ dar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worlds .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curi@@ osity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adap@@ t to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive wil@@ d@@ card .
in order to adap@@ t success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
play &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cla@@ w .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ low@@ ship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each con@@ cei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
so two cou@@ ples each con@@ cei@@ ving one baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the con@@ ception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that con@@ ception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want to imagine that , in one case , the s@@ per@@ m is carrying a y chro@@ mo@@ some , meeting that x chro@@ mo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the s@@ per@@ m is carrying an x chro@@ mo@@ some , meeting the x chro@@ mo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so i wear two ha@@ ts in most of what i do .
as the one h@@ at , i do history of an@@ at@@ omy .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ al@@ t with an@@ at@@ omy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ al@@ t with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other h@@ at that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activi@@ st , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ joined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fi@@ sm -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an x@@ y chro@@ mo@@ som@@ al basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chro@@ mo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ st@@ es .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ st@@ es are pu@@ mp@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual l@@ acks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and this is a syn@@ dro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develo@@ ps more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ v@@ aries inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ st@@ es inside , and she has a y chro@@ mo@@ some .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
fe@@ males , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands make and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s , which are a ma@@ scul@@ in@@ izing hor@@ m@@ one .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chro@@ mo@@ som@@ al ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ males like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s than the woman born with te@@ st@@ es who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 1@@ 9 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ v@@ aries and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pla@@ sia .
he had x@@ x chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a ma@@ scul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were ma@@ scul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical ma@@ scul@@ ine component of hor@@ mon@@ es .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody su@@ spe@@ cted anything .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 1@@ 9 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating inter@@ n@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female inter@@ n@@ ally .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
some people who have x@@ x chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different vari@@ e@@ ties .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fi@@ sm , or it &apos;s con@@ joined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of surger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social cate@@ gor@@ ies .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ at@@ omy comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ at@@ omy in terms of your history .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those cate@@ gor@@ iz@@ ations .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
and our nation &apos;s really foun@@ ded on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ lin .
i had a lot of journ@@ alists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists there isn &apos;t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these cate@@ gor@@ ies that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical cate@@ gor@@ ies that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity cate@@ gor@@ ies are a lot more fu@@ z@@ zy than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 9@@ 5 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nucle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ comfor@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic cate@@ gor@@ ies we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is b@@ att@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
we have very difficult conversations now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twit@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bu@@ ry them yet .
if it stopped twit@@ ching , you bu@@ ry them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take v@@ ital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple cate@@ gor@@ ies as we &apos;ve had before .
now you might think that all this brea@@ kin@@ g-@@ down of cate@@ gor@@ ies would make somebody like me really happy .
i &apos;m a political progre@@ s@@ sive , i def@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these cate@@ gor@@ ies are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first admit to you that i &apos;m a huge f@@ an of the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers .
i know they were rac@@ ists , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so bo@@ ld and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ t@@ table .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers .
the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all re@@ call , what our foun@@ ding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ at@@ omy .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they lev@@ el@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ at@@ omy that mat@@ tered was the common@@ ality of an@@ at@@ omy , not the difference in an@@ at@@ omy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ al@@ istic world .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very vag@@ ue concept of birth@@ right .
they were moving towards a natur@@ al@@ istic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ v@@ aries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citiz@@ en@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; ain &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of color appe@@ aling to a common@@ ality of an@@ at@@ omy over a difference of an@@ at@@ omy , again , success@@ fully .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain divi@@ sions .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some divi@@ sions , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ at@@ omy .
i don &apos;t want to say five-@@ year-@@ olds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical divi@@ sions that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings con@@ cei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both con@@ cei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
hen@@ ry , by contra@@ st , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 19@@ 80 .
simply by vir@@ tu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than hen@@ ry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
hen@@ ry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bio@@ logically , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of weir@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
hen@@ ry , by vir@@ tu@@ e of being assu@@ med to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by vir@@ tu@@ e of being assu@@ med to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ fted , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that hen@@ ry has in all the states , na@@ mely , the right to mar@@ ry .
hen@@ ry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical cate@@ gor@@ ies that per@@ si@@ st that are in many ways proble@@ matic and ques@@ tion@@ able .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ at@@ omy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ at@@ omy might start falling apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic at@@ titude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , tex@@ as has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chro@@ mo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chro@@ mo@@ some .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es .
but this is also very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
if we look at one of the foun@@ ding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ at@@ omy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab@@ ra@@ d@@ ors that i know that are more capable of in@@ formed , intelligent , mat@@ ure decisions about sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ olds that i know .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also won@@ ders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s sc@@ ann@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mr@@ i ?
do we really want to go there ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job stru@@ ggling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sex@@ u@@ ally attrac@@ ted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ dered , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ joined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very bad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political as@@ y@@ lu@@ m instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a fe@@ mini@@ st , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fe@@ males in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from cro@@ ss-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ males , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ mini@@ st , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we in@@ je@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ at@@ omy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ es@@ sion , and that is , i &apos;m out@@ f@@ it@@ -@@ obsessed .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blo@@ gging a different , col@@ or@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occa@@ sion .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft sto@@ res .
aw@@ w , thank you .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ op@@ ping allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ op@@ ping like my own personal tre@@ asure hun@@ t .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ p@@ ants and that &apos;s it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m sp@@ r@@ ings .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ f@@ its right now .
does that sound good ?
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these ad@@ ven@@ tures wearing nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y ti@@ ger . &quot;
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
it is almost physi@@ o@@ logically impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red p@@ ants .
if you are happy , you are going to at@@ tract other happy people to you .
tu@@ es@@ day : f@@ itting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surr@@ ounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
we@@ d@@ nes@@ day : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing dre@@ ss@@ -up , or that i remind them of their seven@@ -year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
so there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to b@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t need to get emo@@ tionally att@@ ached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , col@@ or@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
this is what we call , in our lab , sen@@ sible design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m it@@ alian origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y grows up with this picture on the wall of his bed@@ room -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 rac@@ ing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sen@@ sors collec@@ ting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an ac@@ tu@@ ating component .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been b@@ lan@@ ke@@ ted with networks , electr@@ onics .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be ac@@ tu@@ ated .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
just as an a@@ side , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cru@@ st , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and ac@@ tu@@ ating is enter@@ ing our everyday objects .
that &apos;s from an exhibi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ el@@ l@@ i is organiz@@ ing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an ac@@ tu@@ ator .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and ac@@ tu@@ ating it .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been dep@@ loyed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use an@@ on@@ y@@ mous and aggre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 200@@ 6 .
it &apos;s when it@@ al@@ y won the so@@ c@@ cer world cup .
some of you might remember , it was it@@ al@@ y and france playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ but@@ t .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ oring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the co@@ lo@@ s@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
you see the tim@@ el@@ ine on the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match begins -- sil@@ ence .
france sco@@ res . it@@ al@@ y sco@@ res .
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
second half . end of normal time .
first over@@ time , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ but@@ t in a moment .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the win@@ ning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co ma@@ ssi@@ mo , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tra@@ sh as it moves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ at@@ tle , just over a year ago , to ta@@ g what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little ta@@ g , onto the tra@@ sh and then started following it .
here are the results we just ob@@ ta@@ ined .
from se@@ at@@ tle ...
after one week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of ine@@ ffici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transportation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavioral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my colleag@@ ue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s ac@@ tu@@ ating our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in z@@ ara@@ go@@ za , sp@@ ain .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that sp@@ ain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , ta@@ ps , opening and clo@@ sing .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
well , we presen@@ ted this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ lo@@ ch .
he liked it very much .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the en@@ tr@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
we called it digital water pa@@ vi@@ lion .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ la@@ shing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ lish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
here &apos;s the building working .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , testing the sen@@ sors that open the water .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sen@@ sors stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from z@@ ara@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predict@@ able .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chron@@ y .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regular con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation in two dimensions .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of res@@ olution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an in new york and la sc@@ al@@ a in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dancing .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different res@@ olu@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion capture .
so you can re@@ construc@@ t a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london oly@@ mp@@ ics .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud rais@@ ing -- like bar@@ n rais@@ ing , but with a cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acces@@ sible through the internet .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organiz@@ ing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbo@@ l .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pre@@ ssing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , collec@@ tively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the oly@@ mp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ ul@@ ate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
i first went to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
i was in a@@ we .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ z@@ zy , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
some ref@@ use to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cru@@ mble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re is@@ ol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i am brea@@ thing in its ancient atmosphere .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ as@@ ing min@@ er@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shes many forms of life .
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they mel@@ t ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
it &apos;s a very rare occa@@ sion that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg ro@@ lling .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge-@@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
it &apos;s about 1@@ 20 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
thank you .
i have had the distin@@ ct ble@@ ssing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the coo@@ lest i ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
and that was the on@@ set of als .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
he only has use of his eyes .
i was ex@@ posed to him .
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor ton@@ y , temp@@ t , and his cause .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to ton@@ y again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ ph@@ en ha@@ w@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upper e@@ ch@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing insur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
these devices aren &apos;t acces@@ sible to people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s ar@@ cha@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to ca@@ sh .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : ton@@ y &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ ve@@ sty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a la@@ ser poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
so they go around and do art inst@@ al@@ lations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cu@@ ss words , then it was bush s@@ land@@ ers and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their presen@@ tations .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a la@@ ser and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be awe@@ some . &quot;
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ shed a couple things .
one , we batter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the insur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a ste@@ ph@@ en ha@@ w@@ king machine .
which was awe@@ some .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing we did is we flew seven program@@ mers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back gar@@ age , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and program@@ mers and con@@ spir@@ acy the@@ ori@@ sts and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we program@@ med , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the ey@@ e@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ gla@@ sses that we bought at the ven@@ ice beach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from home de@@ po@@ t and radio sha@@ ck .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no lim@@ it@@ ations .
there &apos;s no insur@@ ance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awe@@ some .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ ve@@ iling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of program@@ ming , carb@@ -@@ fe@@ st and all@@ -@@ night se@@ s@@ sions , ton@@ y drew again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
we kic@@ ked his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
i feel like i had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that awe@@ some ?
so that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a ske@@ tch .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
ar@@ m@@ strong twit@@ tered about us , and then in de@@ ce@@ mber , time magazine hon@@ o@@ red us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
the coo@@ lest thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in a@@ pri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ff@@ en mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angel@@ es , there &apos;s going to be an exhibi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the street art scene -- ban@@ k@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awe@@ some .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the ey@@ e@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cular reco@@ gni@@ tion technology , but i just recogn@@ ized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wi@@ de@@ ly read children &apos;s author , in fact .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever chose far@@ mer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ phan@@ ies .
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard bol@@ lin@@ g@@ broke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
i was the guy be@@ aten up bloo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; l@@ oun@@ ge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 8@@ 5 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. pos@@ ten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m disa@@ p@@ pointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hosp@@ ice .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of a@@ shes and was placed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any i talked about presen@@ ted itself .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved h@@ ers .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs -- it needs di@@ gn@@ ity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explo@@ sion as you climb through 3,000 ft .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
it sounds sc@@ ary .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1@@ d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the pi@@ lot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
you could see man@@ ha@@ tt@@ an .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pi@@ lot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
and then he says three words -- the most une@@ mo@@ tional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; br@@ ace for impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
i could see in her eyes , it was ter@@ ror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to m@@ end , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
i no longer want to pos@@ t@@ pon@@ e anything in life .
and that ur@@ gency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real regre@@ t .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
and i regre@@ t@@ ted the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as i reflec@@ ted on that , i decided to eli@@ minate negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please b@@ low up . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docu@@ ment@@ aries .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic tal@@ ent ...
... yet .
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
i realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
i was given the gift of a mirac@@ le , of not dying that day .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bomb .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment fac@@ ility .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real@@ -@@ time control systems .
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a no@@ te@@ book that is used by a ma@@ inten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pper .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gray box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is de@@ la@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
i want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pper part , used multiple zero-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real@@ -@@ time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab r@@ at that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ v@@ ors of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a dire@@ cted attack .
it &apos;s completely dire@@ cted .
the dro@@ pper is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gray box if a specific con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
so we ex@@ trac@@ ted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very profes@@ sion@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pper of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is rocket science .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about -- around about 1@@ 5,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assemb@@ ly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for tim@@ ers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
so we do need target the@@ ories that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
in order to get target the@@ ories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bu@@ she@@ h@@ r nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ an@@ z fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
and if you mani@@ pu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cr@@ ack the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
i started to research scientific literature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ an@@ z and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a ca@@ sca@@ de , and each ca@@ sca@@ de holds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divided into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been ob@@ ta@@ ined over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to reco@@ ver .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different ang@@ les .
the small war@@ head is taking one ca@@ sca@@ de , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six ca@@ sca@@ des and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
it is nat@@ an@@ z , and it is only nat@@ an@@ z .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sen@@ sors -- so for example , from pressure sen@@ sors and vi@@ bra@@ tion sen@@ sors -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ timate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
so it &apos;s just like from the hol@@ lywood movies where during the he@@ ist , the obser@@ vation camera is fed with pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded video .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggre@@ s@@ sive .
the idea is to circum@@ v@@ ent a digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big stea@@ m tur@@ b@@ ine gets too over speed , you must open reli@@ ef val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can b@@ low up .
and neither your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ f@@ ics , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an autom@@ o@@ bile factory .
it is gener@@ ic .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an att@@ ac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use conventional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such att@@ acks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
thanks .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wi@@ de@@ ly repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ ssa@@ d is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the mo@@ ssa@@ d is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i fil@@ med in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been im@@ mer@@ sing myself into see@@ min@@ gly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine socie@@ tal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them enter@@ ta@@ ining and acces@@ sible to an audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of br@@ anding and spon@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 20@@ 11 ted talk .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , cor@@ po@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce@@ -@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much h@@ int as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
it &apos;s a lot .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the entire film is fun@@ ded by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is bran@@ ded from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ title spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ di@@ um , the sta@@ ples center ...
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever .
and so the film explo@@ res this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
i &apos;m a re@@ dun@@ d@@ ant person .
that was more for emp@@ ha@@ sis .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand x title spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every cate@@ g@@ ory we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ te@@ sy of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is trans@@ par@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ no@@ tation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1.@@ 5 million .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
j@@ k : both .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
awe@@ some .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which br@@ ands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with .@@ .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the-@@ record conversation . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
i was ama@@ zed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the frac@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the ma@@ sses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fat@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a google image search for trans@@ par@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
this is was the problem : trans@@ par@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or de@@ ce@@ it ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; character@@ ized by vi@@ sibility or acces@@ sibility of information , especially concer@@ ning business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about trans@@ par@@ ency these days .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , trans@@ par@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like that odd , sti@@ l@@ l-@@ scre@@ aming bear .
it &apos;s un@@ predict@@ able -- like this odd country road .
and it &apos;s also very ri@@ sky .
what else is ri@@ sky ?
eating an entire bo@@ wl of cool whi@@ p .
that &apos;s very ri@@ sky .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john b@@ ond and richard k@@ ir@@ sh@@ en@@ b@@ au@@ m for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make great big , giant hol@@ lywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hol@@ lywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant hol@@ lywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine ca@@ bin@@ et , you will see ban de@@ od@@ or@@ ant .
while any@@ time i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fab@@ ulous sc@@ ents .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fu@@ sion &quot; or a &quot; para@@ di@@ se win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- solid , ro@@ l@@ l-@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
that &apos;s the two-@@ cent t@@ our .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent t@@ our .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challeng@@ er brand .
so we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
ban is bl@@ ank .
that &apos;s a great question .
super@@ ior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
we talk about bo@@ ld , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this cate@@ g@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and we@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep you fre@@ sh@@ er longer -- better fre@@ sh@@ ness , more fre@@ sh@@ ness , three times fre@@ sh@@ er .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi-@@ million dollar cor@@ po@@ ration .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like really nice clothes .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
unique .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , style i am would be like dark gla@@ mor .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
but usually i have an acces@@ sor@@ y , like sun@@ gla@@ sses , or i like cry@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classic conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
the brand that i am is , i would call it ca@@ sual fly .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part b@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n girl -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
i sell pet to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i deliver the goods .
failed writ@@ er-@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic brand .
is that something ?
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
i &apos;m tom .
well we can &apos;t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark gla@@ mor and ca@@ sual fly .
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ al@@ t@@ man in pit@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things ste@@ m@@ med and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ m@@ med and started with my family in west vir@@ gin@@ ia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
what is the mac@@ he@@ te ? what pu@@ pa stage are you in now ?
why is it important to re@@ boo@@ t ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other meta@@ mor@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of ro@@ l@@ ler co@@ a@@ ster are you on ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ mentary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ g@@ an sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a mind@@ ful / play brand .
those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very nic@@ ely together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a para@@ do@@ x with those .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their str@@ eng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
what other br@@ ands are like that ?
the first on here is the classic , apple .
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
now there &apos;s play@@ ful br@@ ands and mind@@ ful br@@ ands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , mind@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a play@@ ful , mind@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , re@@ served , conserva@@ tive ?
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful , being fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like er@@ ro@@ l fl@@ y@@ n@@ n , n@@ im@@ ble or a@@ gile , prof@@ an@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , ma@@ gical or my@@ sti@@ cal like g@@ and@@ al@@ f .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
are you mind@@ ful , sophisticated like 00@@ 7 ?
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , se@@ cure , sac@@ red , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like the d@@ al@@ ai la@@ ma or yo@@ da ?
over the course of this film , we had 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mind@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adver@@ tis@@ er would normally never get behind .
they en@@ abled us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commerci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
we went to san pa@@ ul@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door adverti@@ sing .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no pos@@ ters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into ca@@ sh@@ -@@ stra@@ pped schools all across america .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ acted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
they cut out the midd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film pre@@ mi@@ ered at the sun@@ dance film fes@@ tiv@@ al , let &apos;s take a look .
according to bur@@ rel@@ les , the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered in jan@@ u@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media im@@ pres@@ sions for this film .
that &apos;s literally co@@ vering just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of mom@@ en@@ tum .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to ad@@ vi@@ sed their cli@@ ents not to take part .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pu@@ shing them more towards failure .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ ver@@ se , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be reward challeng@@ ed .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a ca@@ ge .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to embrace trans@@ par@@ ency .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and trans@@ par@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embrace trans@@ par@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
em@@ c presents : &quot; embrace trans@@ par@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
so , mor@@ g@@ an , in the name of trans@@ par@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
my name is am@@ it .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with muse@@ u@@ ms and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ u@@ ms from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not compla@@ ining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these muse@@ u@@ ms and these ar@@ t@@ works .
and so when i started traveling and going to these muse@@ u@@ ms , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more acces@@ sible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
so , simple : you come to goo@@ g@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
you look around at all these muse@@ u@@ ms here .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ f@@ fi@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the harve@@ sters &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the met .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the meta@@ -@@ data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ ce@@ less .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
went in , and i started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cr@@ acks .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ acks .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called collec@@ tions .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ ancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national gall@@ ery .
you can an@@ no@@ t@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the muse@@ u@@ ms .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that &apos;s been my hu@@ mb@@ ling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their ar@@ t@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
and the biggest question i get asked now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a represen@@ tation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mi@@ sphere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tually ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experim@@ ental quantum physici@@ sts , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intu@@ ition to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intu@@ ition ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intu@@ ition from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intu@@ ition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physici@@ st .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physici@@ st , because they don &apos;t play with car stop@@ s , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intu@@ ition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws quantum mechan@@ ics .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so i made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here i &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with a fresh si@@ lic@@ on wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming po@@ ol@@ -@@ shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analo@@ gy .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded ele@@ v@@ ator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in an ele@@ v@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frankly , sc@@ are them .
so quantum mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anim@@ ate objects feel the same way .
the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ anim@@ ate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have quantum mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to k@@ ick out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and suc@@ ked out all the air , and then we co@@ ol@@ ed it down now , all alone in the ele@@ v@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we measured its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ anding and con@@ trac@@ ting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ br@@ ate and not vi@@ br@@ ate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so in one case : all the tril@@ lions of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
now it &apos;s only at preci@@ se times when they ali@@ g@@ n .
the rest of the time they &apos;re de@@ lo@@ c@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places .
i think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness handle your body being de@@ lo@@ c@@ alized in space ?
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intu@@ ition , that it seems like all the objects in the ele@@ v@@ ator are really just quantum objects just cra@@ m@@ med into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weir@@ dness of quantum mechan@@ ics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to at@@ tract new resi@@ dents .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ z@@ ens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just sub@@ stitu@@ te a@@ partment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the existing a@@ part@@ ments .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the surr@@ ounding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ str@@ actions of construction .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new a@@ partment building , as long as the rules there were ones that fac@@ il@@ it@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vi@@ er and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ d@@ ur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as .
at one point , ja@@ vi@@ er said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an emb@@ as@@ sy -- give some to the u.s. emb@@ as@@ sy ; give some to the can@@ adi@@ an emb@@ as@@ sy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those emb@@ as@@ sy gr@@ ounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 200@@ 9 , hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching constitu@@ tional crisis .
at the next reg@@ ularly sche@@ d@@ ul@@ ed election , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that pro@@ mis@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his chi@@ ef of staff .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the b@@ are ess@@ enti@@ als .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the existing a@@ partment hol@@ ders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ ate@@ mal@@ a sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk .
he showed it to ja@@ vi@@ er .
they called me .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in de@@ ce@@ mber we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pa@@ use , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on jan@@ u@@ ary fourth and fif@@ th .
so i presen@@ ted another fac@@ t-@@ filled lec@@ ture that inclu@@ ded a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to persu@@ a@@ de the hon@@ d@@ ur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 2@@ 50 hundre@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ res .
everybody app@@ lau@@ ded po@@ lit@@ ely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and it got to the ess@@ ence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
and the insight of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inve@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ stru@@ st .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and shor@@ tly ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter , on jan@@ u@@ ary 19th , they vot@@ ed in the congress to am@@ end their constitu@@ tion to have a constitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the congress in fav@@ or of this constitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
to be part of the constitu@@ tion , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on fe@@ bru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
immediately after that vote , on fe@@ bru@@ ary 21st to the 2@@ 4@@ th , a de@@ leg@@ ation of about 30 hon@@ d@@ ur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is south kore@@ a .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south kore@@ a -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ m@@ its .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is sin@@ ga@@ po@@ re .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
so if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for man@@ agers to come in , and also an ex@@ ternal legal system .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me court be the court of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al system there .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some fin@@ an@@ cing .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to lo@@ cate in the ameri@@ ca@@ s , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
around the world , there &apos;s 7@@ 00 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go to the united states .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as ?
or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to at@@ tract new resi@@ dents ?
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
and my friends from hon@@ d@@ ur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they followed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply docu@@ mented all the various t@@ asks that these ce@@ os engaged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these t@@ asks .
and they found that the average ce@@ o engaged in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 t@@ asks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute cate@@ g@@ ory versus your one hour cate@@ g@@ ory ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day cho@@ o@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
so when i was a graduate student at stan@@ ford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
they had 2@@ 50 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ t@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occa@@ sion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thous@@ and@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and i asked the man@@ ager , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
and he pointed to the bu@@ slo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
here &apos;s their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of j@@ am .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the en@@ tr@@ ance of the store .
we there put out six different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am or 24 different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some j@@ am ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
now cho@@ o@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affe@@ cts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ ential decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
so now for the topic of today : financial sav@@ ings .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , em@@ ir k@@ am@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i jan@@ g where we looked at the reti@@ rement sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.@@ s .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement sav@@ ings plan , the 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s like@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that indeed there was a corre@@ lation .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less partici@@ pation rate .
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , partici@@ pation rates were around in the mid-@@ 70s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , partici@@ pation rates have now dropped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you &apos;re consi@@ dering their future financial well-being .
well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to off@@ ering people more and more choices .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay cho@@ o@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ ctively better .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pic@@ king from that stun@@ ning display .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research ven@@ ues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous re@@ dun@@ d@@ ant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the cho@@ o@@ sing experience .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 2@@ 6 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when the golden cat cor@@ po@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat lit@@ ter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
the typical wal@@ mar@@ t today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
but the n@@ in@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce .
now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ i@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
every single harvard employe@@ e is now automatically en@@ ro@@ lled in a life@@ cycle fund .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
now before we started our se@@ ssion this afternoon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all@@ -@@ expen@@ se@@ s-@@ paid free va@@ cation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his offer .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had obje@@ ctively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would v@@ enture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which brings me to the second technique for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ tiz@@ ation .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to ca@@ sh ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that i did with sh@@ l@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ t@@ z@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o prev@@ it@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a se@@ ssion where they &apos;re doing en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment for their 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan .
and during that se@@ ssion , we kept the se@@ ssion exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
the third technique : cate@@ gor@@ ization .
we can handle more cate@@ gor@@ ies than we can handle choices .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
it turns out that in we@@ g@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magaz@@ ines and i divi@@ de them up into 10 cate@@ gor@@ ies , versus i show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divi@@ de them up into 20 cate@@ gor@@ ies , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better cho@@ o@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
because the cate@@ gor@@ ies tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry di@@ sp@@ la@@ ys .
one is called &quot; ja@@ z@@ z &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
if you think the display on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right is ja@@ z@@ z , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ z@@ z and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ z@@ z and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly use@@ less cate@@ gor@@ ization sche@@ me .
the cate@@ gor@@ ies need to say something to the cho@@ o@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here &apos;s a german car manufac@@ tu@@ re@@ r that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
car colors , ex@@ ter@@ ior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ fts .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ fts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
what am i going to look at ?
how engaged you are .
if you keep h@@ itting the de@@ fa@@ ult but@@ ton per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhel@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re h@@ itting that de@@ fa@@ ult but@@ ton over and over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is presen@@ ted .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
even though cho@@ o@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be engaged .
so let me re@@ ca@@ p .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; cate@@ gor@@ ize -- we can handle more cate@@ gor@@ ies , less choices ; condition for complexity .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho@@ o@@ sy about cho@@ o@@ sing .
and the more we &apos;re able to be cho@@ o@@ sy about cho@@ o@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of cho@@ o@@ sing .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m k@@ ev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the tr@@ ends man@@ ager at youtube , and i profes@@ sion@@ ally watch youtube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sin@@ gers , come@@ di@@ ans -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video up@@ lo@@ aded to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of partici@@ pation and unexpe@@ c@@ ted@@ ness .
all right , let &apos;s go .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
woo@@ o !
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , bear v@@ as@@ que@@ z pos@@ ted this video that he had shot outside his home in yo@@ se@@ m@@ ite national park .
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 2@@ 3 million times .
this is a char@@ t of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , bear .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yo@@ se@@ m@@ ite mountain bear .
and he had pos@@ ted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been pos@@ ted all the way back in jan@@ u@@ ary .
so what happened here ?
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l pos@@ ted this tw@@ e@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ me@@ l introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
re@@ be@@ c@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a char@@ t of what it looked like .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have just sp@@ rou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
michael j@@ . ne@@ l@@ son from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
unlike the one-@@ way entertainment of the 20th century , this community partici@@ pation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an cat &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed anima@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
even ca@@ ts were watching this video .
ca@@ ts were watching other ca@@ ts watch this video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ ong@@ st this tech@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ ky internet culture .
there were re@@ mi@@ xes .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
and then it went international .
an entire re@@ mix community sp@@ rou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bow &quot; or re@@ be@@ c@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an cat ? &quot;
what scrip@@ ts could you have written that would have conta@@ ined this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy prote@@ sting bicy@@ cle fin@@ es in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
so i got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , ca@@ sey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
what does it mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative particip@@ ating communities , complete unexpe@@ c@@ ted@@ ness , these are character@@ is@@ tics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popu@@ lar@@ ity .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justi@@ n bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
no one has to green@@ -@@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ow@@ nership in our own pop culture .
and these are not character@@ is@@ tics of old media , and they &apos;re b@@ arely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the astoni@@ shing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
he is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
he re@@ treated into sil@@ ence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grand@@ father .
i never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had di@@ sti@@ lled itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was in@@ con@@ cei@@ v@@ able to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
so after a four-@@ year sa@@ g@@ a that de@@ fi@@ es fic@@ tion , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea disgu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of p@@ ir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
my first memor@@ ies are from the boat -- the stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty horiz@@ on .
i don &apos;t remember the p@@ ir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mal@@ a@@ y@@ sian coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
after three months in a refu@@ ge@@ e camp , we lan@@ ded in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations sha@@ ping a new life together .
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a wor@@ kin@@ g-@@ class su@@ bur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
unlike the sett@@ led midd@@ le-@@ class su@@ bur@@ bs , whose existence i was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
the sm@@ el@@ ls from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
and the s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assemb@@ ly line , working six days , double shi@@ fts .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cations .
we were poor .
all the dollars were allo@@ cated and extra tu@@ ition in english and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mi@@ ssed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
two pa@@ irs of sto@@ ck@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ k@@ les , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; s@@ lit@@ -@@ eye &quot; and the occa@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; a@@ sian , go home . &quot;
go home to where ?
something sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
there was a gather@@ ing of res@@ ol@@ ve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will by@@ pass you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ ci@@ an and opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gry and inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , and trou@@ b@@ led children caught between two worlds .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ sors were sou@@ ght .
centers were establi@@ shed .
i lived in paralle@@ l worlds .
in one , i was the classic a@@ sian student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the deman@@ ds that i made on myself .
in the other , i was en@@ me@@ shed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ g@@ ically scar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and is@@ o@@ lation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was cho@@ sen as the young austr@@ alian of the year .
and i was ca@@ ta@@ pul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
tan le , an@@ on@@ y@@ mous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , refu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ st , invited to speak in ven@@ ues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an un@@ sun@@ g su@@ bur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two daugh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
she remin@@ ded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
no had never been an option .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke out on you@@ th une@@ mp@@ loy@@ ment and education and the ne@@ g@@ lect of the mar@@ gin@@ alized and the di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not set@@ tle into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be than@@ k@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
i have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
there was an energy there , an im@@ pla@@ cable opti@@ mism , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mil@@ ity and dar@@ ing .
so i followed my hun@@ ches .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the la@@ bel &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
at the end of each day , i made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i made the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
after only one trip .
my hun@@ ches again .
three months later i had re@@ lo@@ cated , and the adv@@ enture has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local man@@ dar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a man@@ dar@@ in whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to court and pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goo@@ d@@ by@@ e .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ hi@@ st temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her ca@@ ske@@ t .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the ca@@ ske@@ t .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
defe@@ at would have come too easily .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet i am afraid of privile@@ ge , of ea@@ se , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
can i give them a bow in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the vast horiz@@ on that guar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it and still see them safe@@ ly through , i would .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
or is it photograph@@ y ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mi@@ xed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trig@@ ger .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trig@@ ger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of re@@ alism .
when i say re@@ alism , i mean photo@@ -@@ re@@ alism .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look real@@ istic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illu@@ sion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illu@@ sion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not really what is real@@ istic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ istic really .
so i think the ba@@ sics are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
it &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different re@@ alities .
so the things that make a photograph look real@@ istic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a real@@ istic result .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distin@@ gu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
so by mat@@ ching color , contra@@ st and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photo@@ graphic defe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , de@@ satur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
so here &apos;s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip .
the sho@@ res are from a different location .
the underwater part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dish .
so to achieve a real@@ istic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a ske@@ tch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ istic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at ra@@ d@@ b@@ ou@@ d university is we ap@@ pointed a chi@@ ef listening off@@ ic@@ er .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my wi@@ f@@ i scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and i put my challenge on 9@@ 5 k@@ g .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
and it &apos;s collected by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ o@@ logic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ f@@ i scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explo@@ sion , doub@@ led demand and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would be the ne@@ are@@ st a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the ne@@ are@@ st life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an i@@ pa@@ d appli@@ cation .
we made an appli@@ cation for la@@ y@@ ar , au@@ g@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and whenever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your micro@@ soft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ are@@ st a@@ ed which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleag@@ ue univer@@ sities , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these a@@ e@@ ds all around the world .
that whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
hu@@ h . han@@ g on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just s@@ ki@@ p -- i &apos;ll just s@@ ki@@ p through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the ro@@ ck@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
we se@@ lect a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall .
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fi@@ res when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named eri@@ k micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ v@@ eling out si@@ de@@ walks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good develo@@ per would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a cu@@ te little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
so you agree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
so it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dynamics on it .
this is a mode@@ st little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the sm@@ alle@@ st of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s .
it &apos;s very important that these t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies out of them .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and then se@@ at@@ tle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ gged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
and chicago just ro@@ lled it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ walks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ ne@@ ls , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and that &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is t@@ ack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
they are fru@@ str@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not compla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fi@@ x@@ ing it .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of ti@@ m o &apos;@@ re@@ il@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
so scot@@ t gets this call .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this off@@ icial knowledge base .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really lou@@ d and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tra@@ sh@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tra@@ sh@@ can behind the house .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? y@@ ep .
turned tra@@ sh@@ can on its side . walked home .
goo@@ d@@ night sweet o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citiz@@ en helped another citiz@@ en , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and chea@@ per alternative to government services .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we str@@ eng@@ then our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to ref@@ lect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ in@@ ch layer on top .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ r@@ acy .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dise@@ m@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ r@@ acy sex@@ y .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the mach@@ in@@ ery of government .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ the@@ se@@ c movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 2@@ 5@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s re@@ quest for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ ra@@ tically active .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 2@@ 8 , so i am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sho@@ v@@ eling out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ bage can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ v@@ eling out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all along , and many people do .
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citiz@@ en@@ ship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ mps in technology that seem so fast that we can b@@ arely keep on top of it .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ pro@@ ces@@ sors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a ta@@ x@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ y@@ o in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by or@@ ders of ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de every few years .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these expon@@ ential cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
now i &apos;m an optimi@@ st , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
what &apos;s that new state that the world is hea@@ ding toward ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been sh@@ rin@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , steri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i think that there &apos;s the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corporate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
and those that were like that started to split and divi@@ de .
and those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of une@@ qu@@ al di@@ vision of the chemicals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemicals and divided more .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get ex@@ pressed more .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstr@@ action .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mind@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ ied .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed stea@@ dy since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ poses is we can now write things in this code .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ ports .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 2@@ 2 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ enty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communi@@ cating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , anti@@ bio@@ tic resistance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were fa@@ vo@@ red by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of dna .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really use@@ less without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the ne@@ ural structures .
so neurons are the information processing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tri@@ cks of communi@@ cating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
here i have a very complicated , me@@ ss@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar me@@ ss@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ gy to it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar organisms have gone through -- abstr@@ acting out our metho@@ ds of recording , presen@@ ting , processing information .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechan@@ isms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ v@@ olution program right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electr@@ onics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , au@@ to@@ ca@@ tal@@ y@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ in@@ forces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ sion of curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechan@@ isms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of instruc@@ tions .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instruc@@ tions .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instruc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ se@@ st to doing what i wanted . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
so find the programs that come clo@@ se@@ st to sor@@ ting numbers .
so of course , random sequences of instruc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by luc@@ k , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combination analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es , and the children inher@@ it the tra@@ its of the sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by comb@@ inations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
score them again .
introduce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sin@@ g@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms .
so we &apos;re the a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
i think it &apos;s very ha@@ u@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selec@@ ted out .
my story begins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ f@@ i sin@@ ger mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
now we do the same with air@@ planes .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dri@@ l@@ ls and machines .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by mach@@ in@@ ery .
and this made me really sad .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a techno@@ pho@@ be .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without tw@@ e@@ eting it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver pocket watch .
and this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing to me .
it became a g@@ il@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of p@@ ir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our f@@ ancy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i ju@@ mped in , i ju@@ mped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
i &apos;ve been illustr@@ ating books since i was 16 .
and so when i saw the i@@ pa@@ d , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect read@@ ers all over the world .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and anima@@ tion and sound and touch .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sen@@ sor@@ ial .
but what are we doing with it ?
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive ap@@ p for the i@@ pa@@ d .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this box be@@ lon@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and actually i become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pa@@ d knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addre@@ ssed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children .
this idea of fi@@ ref@@ lies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pa@@ d , take the fi@@ ref@@ lies out .
and they actually illu@@ minate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be conta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gical device within the device .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
all along , all fant@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic .
this is a map that grows and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cha@@ mbers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , glu@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pa@@ d and collect pictures of different natural objects .
when i was a child , i had multiple collec@@ tions of sticks and st@@ ones and pe@@ bb@@ les and shel@@ ls .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
so in bringing back this childhood r@@ itual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then ta@@ g it .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ pa@@ d out with the video on and through au@@ g@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a house@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we &apos;re har@@ ne@@ ssing energy from the sun .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pri@@ sons , on death row .
i spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hope@@ less@@ ness .
and being here at ted and seeing the sti@@ mulation , hearing it , has been very , very ener@@ gi@@ zing to me .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presen@@ tations .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compas@@ sionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , and that mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
her parents were born in sla@@ very in vir@@ gin@@ ia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could b@@ arely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sa@@ ult me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youn@@ gest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cou@@ sin@@ s would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ sin@@ s were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget it .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , ma@@ ma . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
well i ado@@ red my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ ho@@ l . &quot;
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , ma@@ ma . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ pack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ z@@ ily did .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hun@@ g up on that conversation ma@@ ma had with you . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; oh , ma@@ ma tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
i know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s vir@@ tu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 00,000 people in ja@@ ils and pri@@ sons .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this desp@@ air , there is this hope@@ less@@ ness , that is being shaped by these out@@ comes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
in urban communities across this country -- los angel@@ es , phil@@ a@@ del@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently di@@ sen@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vic@@ tion .
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of di@@ sen@@ fran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
and there is this stun@@ ning sil@@ ence .
i represent children .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 1@@ 3@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
we have life im@@ prison@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
and that &apos;s a very sen@@ sible question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they comm@@ it , but do we de@@ serve to kill ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been execu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
a kind of astoni@@ shing error rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we de@@ serve to kill .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla@@ very .
i tell them about terr@@ or@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. st@@ even@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terr@@ or@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and that era of terr@@ or@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of rac@@ ial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and a@@ par@@ the@@ id .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come a@@ par@@ the@@ id without a commitment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in rw@@ anda , even after the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
i was giving some lec@@ tures in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ b@@ ling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany . &quot;
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about execu@@ ting people . &quot;
and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was execu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately je@@ wish ?
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execu@@ te people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the victi@@ m is white than if the victi@@ m is black , 2@@ 2 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the victi@@ m is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ e@@ the@@ less impli@@ cated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , those re@@ alities are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ gin@@ alization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integr@@ ate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more dedi@@ cated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intel@@ lect as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vic@@ tion in our heart .
and it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that i believe compe@@ ls us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit , a wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness to sometimes be in hope@@ less places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
well that ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great privile@@ ge , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ are@@ st friends , these older women , john@@ ni@@ e car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and vir@@ gin@@ ia d@@ ur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , cli@@ f@@ ford d@@ ur@@ r , represen@@ ted dr. king .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it would be so ener@@ gi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initi@@ ative is .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ on@@ gly con@@ vic@@ ted .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of crimin@@ al justice .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sent@@ ences for children .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; m@@ mm m@@ mm m@@ mm . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ geous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t be@@ long to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ i@@ ef .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human di@@ gn@@ ity that must be respe@@ cted by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intel@@ lect and reason .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privile@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because it &apos;s in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
i sometimes push too hard .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i &apos;ve been represen@@ ting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 1@@ 4@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privile@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corporate execu@@ tive . &quot;
and i put in my motion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ t@@ ori@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t and police mis@@ conduc@@ t and ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduc@@ t in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduc@@ t .
and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh go@@ sh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
and as i was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ gged me .
and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you , it was ener@@ gi@@ zing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hope@@ ful .
well i went into the cour@@ t@@ room .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; mr. st@@ even@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
i had written these crazy things .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and assi@@ stant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ t@@ room was filled with people an@@ gry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this hol@@ ler .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ t@@ room and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into court .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty ju@@ mped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ t@@ room ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ t@@ room to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic di@@ gn@@ ity .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
that our vi@@ sions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with vi@@ sions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ icide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t result .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and this re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment and safety .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime cate@@ gor@@ ies .
it was this mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded war on drugs .
that &apos;s where the dramatic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
and we got car@@ ried away with the rhe@@ tor@@ ic of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bicy@@ cle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
and i think our current p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ en@@ tation that we have to change .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve struck a massive ch@@ or@@ d here .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
thre@@ ats , in the wake of bin la@@ den &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . police pe@@ pper sp@@ ray .
v@@ ici@@ ous car@@ tel@@ s . announ@@ cer five : ca@@ us@@ tic cru@@ ise lines .
socie@@ tal deca@@ y . 6@@ 5 dead .
t@@ sun@@ ami war@@ ning . cyber@@ -@@ att@@ acks .
drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
re@@ ces@@ sion . de@@ fa@@ ult . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . egypt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ entially fe@@ e@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a .
now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our danger dete@@ ctor .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
so given a do@@ zen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ entially look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it leads , &quot; is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pe@@ ssi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extin@@ ction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we surely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ p@@ an has more than doub@@ led , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted for inf@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ fold .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peac@@ e@@ ful time ever in human history .
and charles ken@@ ny that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expec@@ tations higher and higher .
in fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars .
the weal@@ th@@ i@@ est ro@@ b@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lu@@ x@@ u@@ ries .
under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , expon@@ entially growing technologies .
my good friend ray k@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il showed that any tool that becomes an information technology ju@@ mps on this curve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doub@@ ling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your pocket is literally a million times chea@@ per and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , re@@ ces@@ sion , depression and boo@@ m time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it &apos;s p@@ lo@@ t@@ ted on a lo@@ g curve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at au@@ to@@ des@@ k call infinite computing ; sen@@ sors and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vac@@ cines and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als ; and a@@ .@@ i .
i mean , how many of you saw the win@@ ning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by i@@ b@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
i mean , that was epi@@ c .
in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper i could .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qui@@ shes human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
and imagine if you would a@@ .@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
four years ago here at ted , ray k@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il and i started a new university called sin@@ gul@@ ar@@ ity university .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have s@@ ounded lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s .
today we can point at do@@ z@@ ens of companies that have done just that .
when i think about creating ab@@ un@@ dance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lu@@ x@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scar@@ ce and making it ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
you see , scar@@ city is contex@@ tual , and technology is a resour@@ ce@@ -@@ liber@@ ating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the mid-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
he invited over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were fed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
but the king of si@@ am , he was fed with alu@@ min@@ um u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
you see , alu@@ min@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ u@@ ment is made of alu@@ min@@ um .
you see , even though alu@@ min@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
it &apos;s all b@@ ound by oxygen and si@@ li@@ ca@@ tes .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made alu@@ min@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w@@ -@@ away men@@ tality .
so let &apos;s project this analo@@ gy going forward .
we think about energy scar@@ city .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is ba@@ the@@ d with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
it &apos;s not about being scar@@ ce , it &apos;s about acces@@ sibility .
and there &apos;s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ generated electricity is 50 percent that of di@@ e@@ sel@@ -@@ generated electricity in india -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a ki@@ lo@@ wat@@ t hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if we have ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ g@@ an turned the vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ e@@ craft back towards the earth , in 199@@ 0 after it just passed satur@@ n ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ tw@@ ater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there &apos;s nan@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy coming on , nan@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an k@@ am@@ en this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called s@@ lin@@ g@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small d@@ or@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand lit@@ ers of clean drin@@ king water a day out of any source -- sal@@ tw@@ ater , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two cents a lit@@ er .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the developing world .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will dep@@ lo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tion of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
think about it , that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re on a smar@@ t@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ un@@ dance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ aliz@@ ing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a@@ .@@ i@@ . , you can cou@@ gh on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and prev@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
i call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explo@@ sion is making the world edu@@ cated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they desire ?
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic in@@ je@@ ction ever .
these people represent tens of tril@@ lions of dollars in@@ je@@ cted into the global economy .
and they will get health@@ ier by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better edu@@ cated by using the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , edu@@ cated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the op@@ pressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large cor@@ po@@ rations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ d@@ it .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ at@@ tle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it fol@@ ds di@@ ct@@ ates its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
and this game has been played by university profes@@ sors and so forth .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern reco@@ gni@@ tion mach@@ in@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ ch@@ est@@ er , a woman who , during the day , was an execu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ ha@@ b clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this expon@@ ential technology .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of the techno@@ -@@ phil@@ anthro@@ pi@@ st .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and i think it starts with one physici@@ an , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ sti@@ ge to be able to do that .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of base@@ ball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
we all love base@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?
base@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great base@@ ball team .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who b@@ ats 300 .
that means that b@@ all@@ player bat@@ ted safe@@ ly , hit safe@@ ly three times out of 10 at b@@ ats .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in major le@@ ag@@ ue base@@ ball ?
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 base@@ ball h@@ it@@ ter ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safe@@ ly out of every 10 .
le@@ gen@@ dary -- as in ted wil@@ li@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dary -- the last major le@@ ag@@ ue base@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular seas@@ on .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ dic@@ it@@ is and you &apos;re re@@ fer@@ red to a surgeon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ de@@ ct@@ om@@ ies .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ o@@ logist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the come@@ back tra@@ il .
and she &apos;s h@@ itting a 2@@ 5@@ 7 .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ dia@@ c surgeon or a nur@@ se prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ tho@@ pe@@ di@@ c surgeon , an ob@@ gy@@ n , a para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physici@@ an or para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to b@@ at .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was in med school .
i was an obse@@ s@@ sive compu@@ l@@ sive student .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that bri@@ an gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
and so i did .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; resi@@ dence at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
and i memor@@ ized everything .
i memor@@ ized in my an@@ at@@ omy class the ori@@ g@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ ter@@ y that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
i even knew the differ@@ ential diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar aci@@ do@@ sis .
and all the while , i was ama@@ ssing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m lau@@ de .
and i came out of medical school with the im@@ pression that if i memor@@ ized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immun@@ ize me against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker was brought to the emer@@ gency department of the hospital where i was working .
at the time i was as@@ signed to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and it was my job , when the emer@@ gency staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology con@@ sul@@ t , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and i saw mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
and when i list@@ ened to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and when i list@@ ened to her chest with a ste@@ tho@@ scope , i could hear cr@@ ac@@ kly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the lun@@ gs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i gave her as@@ p@@ ir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to reli@@ eve the stra@@ in on her heart .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ n@@ ish addi@@ tional information about her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was i that i actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so i signed the dis@@ charge papers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , para@@ medi@@ cs came to take her home .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , i pac@@ ked up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
i walked through the emer@@ gency department on my way home .
and it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emer@@ gency physici@@ ans i know dre@@ ad .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emer@@ gency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the para@@ medi@@ cs brought her back to the emer@@ gency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sev@@ ere sho@@ ck .
and she was b@@ arely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
and the emer@@ g@@ . staff pulled out all the stop@@ s .
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a v@@ enti@@ l@@ ator .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and i went through this ro@@ l@@ ler co@@ a@@ ster , because after they st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would reco@@ ver .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had ir@@ rever@@ sible brain damage .
and the family gather@@ ed .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they re@@ signed themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dr@@ uc@@ ker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , is@@ ol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gu@@ i@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the un@@ healthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what i was feeling .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a do@@ ll .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ the@@ d things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it li@@ fted .
i began to feel a bit better .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cr@@ ack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that if only i re@@ double my effor@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emer@@ gency department at a community hospital just north of tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a s@@ ore thro@@ at .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pre@@ scri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
and two days later i came to do my next emer@@ gency shift , and that &apos;s when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ e@@ tly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the s@@ ore thro@@ at ? &quot;
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
he had a potentially life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening condition called epi@@ glo@@ t@@ ti@@ t@@ is .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bio@@ tics and he reco@@ vered after a few days .
and i went through the same period of shame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emer@@ gency shift , i mi@@ ssed app@@ en@@ dic@@ it@@ is .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
one i thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
i or@@ dered a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleag@@ ue who was doing a reas@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant and called the surge@@ ons .
the other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleag@@ ue to reas@@ se@@ ss him .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant , called the surge@@ ons .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years .
alone , as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the sti@@ l@@ l-@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a co@@ ck@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cr@@ ack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ tho@@ pe@@ di@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physici@@ ans -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ o@@ logical reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ rors to learn everything i can , from one of the first artic@@ les i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ rors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we work in a system where er@@ rors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ acqui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , causing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
in this country , as many as 2@@ 4,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of prev@@ ent@@ able medical er@@ rors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ gged it at 100,000 .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ es@@ timat@@ es , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
and here &apos;s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doub@@ ling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ va@@ sive .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ r@@ ulous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are inev@@ itable .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profes@@ sion@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a ha@@ bit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from para@@ medi@@ cs to the chi@@ ef of car@@ dia@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
and it starts with one physici@@ an at a time .
the re@@ defined physici@@ an is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ u@@ ps that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inev@@ it@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
my name is bri@@ an gol@@ d@@ man .
i am a re@@ defined physici@@ an .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shi@@ fting ba@@ sel@@ ine .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and you &apos;d think he was cha@@ sing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
he was actually collec@@ ting fish .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
a big fish@@ ery was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
now the fish is on the i@@ uc@@ n red list .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gal@@ a@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to gal@@ a@@ pa@@ gos .
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ touched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illustr@@ ate another concept , is called shi@@ fting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surr@@ ounded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
and the fish@@ er@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in gh@@ ana .
when i went there 2@@ 7 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size .
they were mat@@ uring at five centi@@ meters .
they had been pu@@ shed gene@@ tically .
there were still fi@@ shes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introduc@@ tion of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fish@@ ers and this boat , quite u@@ gly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and i went sa@@ iling on it , and we did surve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fi@@ xed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ ef fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very ra@@ pid .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy mess .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collected by fish@@ ers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fi@@ shed .
but it &apos;s not docu@@ mented .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ad@@ just our ba@@ sel@@ ine to the new level , and we don &apos;t re@@ call what was there .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ pol@@ ate forward .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
you can have a suc@@ ces@@ sion of changes .
at the end you want to susta@@ in miser@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
over time , we concentr@@ ate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the ba@@ sel@@ ine .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence presen@@ ted in an earlier mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence presen@@ ted .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ e that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed by fish@@ ery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
because with marine protected areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ cei@@ ve because the ba@@ sel@@ ine has shi@@ fted and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to re@@ set their ba@@ sel@@ ine .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and si@@ mulation .
this is a si@@ mulation of che@@ sa@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
there were gray wh@@ ales in che@@ sa@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar . &quot;
and if you think about &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so touched by the imag@@ ery ?
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my re@@ comm@@ en@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for camer@@ on to do &quot; a@@ v@@ at@@ ar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you very much .
in the 198@@ 0s in the communi@@ st eastern germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
you had to regi@@ ster a sample she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and buy a color la@@ ser prin@@ ter from any major la@@ ser prin@@ ter manufac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fu@@ ss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the att@@ acks based on the att@@ ac@@ kers .
we have three main groups .
we have online crimin@@ als .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry go@@ lu@@ bo@@ v from the city of ki@@ e@@ v in u@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online att@@ acks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their att@@ acks .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir t@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form tar@@ t@@ u in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is al@@ f@@ red gon@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
this is ste@@ ph@@ en wat@@ t .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n sun@@ d@@ in .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the il@@ legal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ op@@ ping from an infected computer .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the swi@@ ss bank account of mr. sa@@ m j@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. j@@ ain himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victi@@ m of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of att@@ ac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opinion , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
groups like an@@ on@@ y@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online att@@ acks .
so those are the three main att@@ ac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like an@@ on@@ y@@ mous doing it for the prote@@ st , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the att@@ acks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate authority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government represen@@ ta@@ tives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
well dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes ?
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted services , services like g@@ ma@@ il .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ ma@@ il or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their discus@@ sions .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tes .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
well in egypt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the egy@@ p@@ tian secret police in a@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of papers .
among those papers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fish@@ er . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egy@@ p@@ tian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the egy@@ p@@ tian government .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-@@ called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by german government off@@ ici@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
if you are a su@@ spect in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citiz@@ en .
why should i worry ?
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
priv@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big f@@ an of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were manufac@@ tured in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ules made of ce@@ ment of a fi@@ xed measu@@ rement that fit together .
very quickly concrete blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
they en@@ abled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 19@@ 4@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this .
it was called the automa@@ tic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every house@@ hold .
it &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
le@@ go made it acces@@ sible .
le@@ go has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
mean@@ while the exact same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks p@@ iled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is re@@ served for experts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits .
let me show you how they work .
lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits are electronic mod@@ ules with each one specific function .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sen@@ sors .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and oran@@ ge is wire .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits allow you to program using very simple intuitive ge@@ stu@@ res .
so to make this b@@ link faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
the idea behind lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acces@@ sible .
we &apos;ve been giving lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ onics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an ele@@ v@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an i@@ po@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been taking lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits to design schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ onics wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever start to play with lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have geor@@ die making ...
a few weeks ago we took lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
to these non-@@ engineers , lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits became another material , electr@@ onics became just another material .
and we want to make this material acces@@ sible to everyone .
so lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits is open-@@ source .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators , of invent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inven@@ ting .
thank you .
